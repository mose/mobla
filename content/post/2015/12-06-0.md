## Busy hackathon in Taipei

This weekend we had our first [hackathon][hackathon] in Taipei, organized by
[Gandi][gandi]. That was pretty fun, to be there on the side of the organizers
without actually being in charge of the organization for once. Such geek
events are always so great for meeting and sharing, being forbidden to
participate didn't prevent me to push some ideas around.

During the course of the weekend, I joined mickey to push the creation of a
[Taiwan group for Elixir][elixirtw], for which we had an idea of a stream
capture feature to gather slack discussion and index them. I also had an idea
of event for [FreeBSD portscamp][portscamp] with marcelo, so we made a FreeBSD
Taiwan group on github as well (with a pretty neat logo). All this was
actually not that much related to the hackathon but just emerging from natural
proximity with other geeks.
