## the Adwar

This week I got 2 links that explore both sides of the adwar. The war on
advertisement exists on the web since it became popular enough to attract
advertisers. [There are no acceptable ads][noads] takes the side of the users,
while [A Never-Ending Story On Ad-Blockers][adblockers] seems to defend and
advise the publishers.

Some media already have blocked the blockers. It's forbidden to escape ads?
This position may appear not to be sustainable. And pushing towards content
sponsoring could have really bad ill effects on the long term. Is there any
escape? Honestly I have to say that I'm partial in that debate. I don't like
ads on what I read, and I don't like ads on what I publish. I even go edit my
/etc/hosts with some custom domains to resolve to 127.0.0.1 sometimes.

So it there was to take sides, I would say advertiser, go to hell. But I'm a
realist. They won't go away. We live in a society where shit has to be bought.
Yes even if you don't need it. Otherwise the system will collapse. That's how
things are. I get some crazy dreams about some [basic income][basicincome]
system, currently [in experiment][basicworld] in various places over the
globe. Such setup would defeat part of this situation, even if it would have
border effects that are unpredictable. But that would not change much for the
big corpo, it would only save the small people. Hmm. Sounds good enough to me,
I won't lie.
