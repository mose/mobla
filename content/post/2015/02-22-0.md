Here it was Chinese New Year this week. A good occasion for those who are not
familiar with chinese state of the web to read about its [web design trends 2015][7]. 
This article is pretty deep and reflects accurately how China uses
its connectivity.

So, xin nian kuai le, and of course, gong xi fa cai. And if you need related
icons, [here are some][7].

## Hello in Firefox

Now that I'm working from Taiwan with a French company, I was have been
searching for a decent solution for video conferencing. Because skype and
google-hangouts are just not things I like to use. I found out that new
versions of firefox include by default a one to one webrtc feature, named
[Hello][1]. It works pretty nicely. I also tried out [Glideroom][2] and
[Hutt][3]. There are also heavier solutions that I tried in the past like the
[big blue button][4].

Unfortunately some dude in the ops team pointed out that webrtc was [not
secure][5], so it's not likely to become a standard for us. Hrum, well, that's
debatable how proprietary solutions are more secure. There is no way to get it
figured out. Anyways Webrtc became a [w3c standard][6] recently, and the
section 12, named security, says: TBD. Let's hope it will be done properly.

Any of you have some first hand experience with any alternative video
conference system, please send me a mail with your feedback.
