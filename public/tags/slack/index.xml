      <description>Happy end of 2015 Take good time, use the calendar rotation as a pretext to have good resolutions, get wasted like if you were a teenager (wait, what? we all are teenagers here?), or do whatever makes you happy if like me you prefer to remain sober. See you in 2016.
SlackCast 2016 We had a lot of discussion with Nauman Tariq about how to make slack usage more lively, more useful, and such things.</description>

      <description>Okay I reckon I&amp;rsquo;m very old school. I began on the net with irc and I still stick to it. I have been confused by the trend that make people use Twitter like if it was some kind of real-time interactive medium. I have watched skype becoming unavoidable, and despicable. I hope Telegram will kill it, honestly.
I have been using hipchat and slack for work. Hipchat was really cool, but slack came later on and seemed more modern and featurefull.</description>
