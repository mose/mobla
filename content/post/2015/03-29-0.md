## Green Ruby New Generation

We had this week a very productive meeting with xenor and tysliu in our
preferred coffee shop. I explained more in detail my workflow and my quality
criterias. So now they can feed the links section and become the major editors
of Green Ruby. I Still keep the role of the publisher. I get their links, I
clean up stuff, verify freshness and reachability, remove superlatives, fix
category if needed.

Special thanks a lot to Xenor and Tysliu (aka. Simon). Now they do the heavy
lifting and they are the reason why Green Ruby is still in your mailbox every
week.
