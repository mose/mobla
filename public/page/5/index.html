<h2 id="that-micro-service-thing:46752485ca0dcc4b52fef655c3c60574">That micro-service thing</h2>

<p>For a while now, and more even since the rise of docker, it becomes a trend to
split applications in parts and approach them as a collection of
micro-services. This is not exactly new, I remember in 2002 having seen
various applications based on this concept. But they had shortcomings.
Development was harder and it imported a whole bunch of increased complexity
because there was a lot of moving parts.</p>

<p>In a project that I have the occasion of following, I can watch the migration
from monolith to micro-service and I can tell you, the architecture change is
not simple technical decision. By splitting application there is a whole lot
of application aspects that move out of the area of the developers team and
are now the responsibility of the infrastructure team. The shift cannot be
taken lightly.</p>

<p>From what I observed, the switch to micro-services can only be efficient if
there was already a shift to a real devops organization. It means that the
development and the infrastructure are more tightly coupled. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s
just a mess. The QA also can get crazy, and the networking layer gets
increased complexity (or even dramatic latencies). Errors and services
resilience also need an extra layer of attention.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t move to micro-services if you are not ready for it, seriously, it can
end up by shooting yourself in the foot.</p>

<h2 id="here-is-2016:af177e0d6352be87fe53a31db08b69a8">Here is 2016</h2>

<p>Well in this last week of 2015, the have not been that much publication and
the list of links is shorter than usual. Everybody is probably just having a
life for a change, which is a good things :)</p>

<p>There is a lot of promising trends that may unleash in the coming year. I hope
to see what ruby 3 will bring. Rails 5 is already almost out there too. But
there is some interesting move on the side of Elixir as well, even if it&rsquo;s
still very young and hacky in my opinion.</p>

<p>On the frontend side, there is that big news that was announced last year,
with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support">Microsoft ditching IE old versions</a> officially on january 12,
it will be on tuesday next week. IE 11 would become the only supported
version. A bold but welcome move. Maybe it will help adoption of JS recent
native APIs. I suspect that if IE dies, jquery will not make any sense anymore
as the JS stack will be more consistent then. But maybe I&rsquo;m wrong, that&rsquo;s just
an intuition. And the end of support doesn&rsquo;t mean there will be an instant
extinction of old IEs, it may still take some more time.</p>

<p>Take good time, use the calendar rotation as a pretext to have good
resolutions, get wasted like if you were a teenager (wait, what? we all are
teenagers here?), or do whatever makes you happy if like me you prefer to
remain sober. See you in 2016.</p>

<h2 id="slackcast-2016:602bde3b83227cc35adf0ad4ea322068">SlackCast 2016</h2>

<p>We had a lot of discussion with Nauman Tariq about how to make slack usage
more lively, more useful, and such things. We worked together on a concept of
event that we want to try next weekend. It will happen next Saturday (Jan 2nd)
around 23:00 UTC (more or less 4 hours). If you want to participate, please
shoot me an <a href="mailto:mose@greenruby.org">email</a>, and we&rsquo;ll give you the precise time when we know
it, plus the how-to-join-in. It will be a first time, it won&rsquo;t be perfect, but
it will be a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Read more about it on the <a href="https://slack-files.com/T05052K3Q-F0FSX2GHG-3330dc8ef1">SlackCast manifesto</a>. You also can join
<a href="http://www.rubyonrails.link/">rubyonrails.link</a>, that&rsquo;s where it will happen.</p>

<h2 id="150-weeks:4ed16e5b224ff8e7f398b527b88e0d35">150 weeks</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a round number, this 150th edition of the Green Ruby Newsletter
is an occasion to see where we are. At this day there are 1,610 subscribers to
the email newsletter. The website has around 250 unique visits per day, which
mostly are RSS readers. Those are anecdotal numbers. As we have no intention
to monetize this initiative, it doesn&rsquo;t matter that much. Soon we will enter
in the red zone in the amount of subscribers and we will need to push some
people out, those who forgot about the newsletter but also forgot to
unsubscribe. It will happen when we reach 1,800 (because Mailchimp is still
free under 2,000 subscribers).</p>

<p>During the whole life of the publication, we never missed one week. Last week,
thanks to Xenor, I even could have some rest. Now I&rsquo;m better, flu never last.
We also have, for a couple of months, much more links contributions (thanks
Nauman Tariq). All in all, our model seems to have been pretty sustainable.</p>

<h2 id="busy-hackathon-in-taipei:b4b86de420849d53ccbec354ab20a437">Busy hackathon in Taipei</h2>

<p>This weekend we had our first <a href="http://hackathon.taipei/en.html">hackathon</a> in Taipei, organized by
<a href="http://gandi.net">Gandi</a>. That was pretty fun, to be there on the side of the organizers
without actually being in charge of the organization for once. Such geek
events are always so great for meeting and sharing, being forbidden to
participate didn&rsquo;t prevent me to push some ideas around.</p>

<p>During the course of the weekend, I joined mickey to push the creation of a
<a href="https://github.com/elixirtw/elixir_tw">Taiwan group for Elixir</a>, for which we had an idea of a stream
capture feature to gather slack discussion and index them. I also had an idea
of event for <a href="https://github.com/FreeBSDTaiwan/portscamp">FreeBSD portscamp</a> with marcelo, so we made a FreeBSD
Taiwan group on github as well (with a pretty neat logo). All this was
actually not that much related to the hackathon but just emerging from natural
proximity with other geeks.</p>

<h2 id="code-in-the-dark:f6454540d52b5466477bc9e3371f78a1">Code in the dark</h2>

<p>My attention was brought this week to <a href="http://codeinthedark.com/">Code in the dark events</a>. It seems
pretty cool. A 15 minutes race in html and css with no preview. But the thing
that brought my attention to that format is the special editor used for those
events with a special effect on the cursor. It seems to add a really dramatic
effect on the competition. We need more ideas like that for pure geek fun.</p>

<h2 id="first-look-at-perl-6:f6454540d52b5466477bc9e3371f78a1">First look at perl 6</h2>

<p>For many people, Perl sounds like trauma. Because it didn&rsquo;t move for a while,
when I hear something is perl code, it sounds like it&rsquo;s legacy code, old and
dusty. Well, Perl 6 is going to come out for christmas and the situation may
change. Perl 6 is in the lab for <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?when_will_perl_6_be_released">15 years</a> now, it&rsquo;s more than
time to get it shipped.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://doc.perl6.org/language/5to6-nutshell">first glance</a>, they seem to have tried to &lsquo;modernize&rsquo; the language,
make it more idiomatic. It even seems it looks more like ruby, with the
replacement of arrow by dots, the optional parenthesis, better exception
handling. Well, overall, it feels cleaner. But it also seem to have some
potential to mix functional and object-oriented in an interesting way.</p>

<p>So, maybe there is going to be a second life for the old perl. It&rsquo;s a breaking
version, old perl code will certainly break on the new version. So it&rsquo;s almost
like a new language. For sure I will still keep ruby as my preferred language,
but I like multilingualism, so maybe I will give it a try .. again (last perl
app I wrote was 12 years ago).</p>

<p>In 2 weeks Gandi organizes with .taipei registry a <a href="http://hackathon.taipei/">Hackhaton</a> with
pretty wide topic. It will be at at the Hi-tech Promotion Center in Taipei on
December 5 and 6. I will be there (part of the jury), so if you want to have
some week-end fun and are in Taipei at that time, feel free to join in. There
will be prizes, free domains and hosting. I would love to see some ruby
projects there.</p>

<h2 id="more-about-bullies:7d0bd163d3b6e38d12756fdafb7e56e1">More about bullies</h2>

<p>This week I read the <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2015/11/09/software-bullying/">reaction of Avdi</a> to the rant of Linus last
week. He proposes a short but insightful angle by just naming it &lsquo;bullying&rsquo;.
It rejoins the damage that I consider the coder-hero culture brings to our
industry.</p>

<p>Certainly the creative process of writing software attract creative people.
They have strong personalities, some have tendencies to mild autism. They move
mountains and their pride make them work day and night to achieve unbelievable
things.</p>

<p>This is good and well, but on the long run, now that we are passing 2
generations of coders, we know that it&rsquo;s not sustainable on the long run.
Plus, it has a disastrous impact on team building. No pyramid was built by a
single hero.</p>

<p>Incidentally I also read an interesting article about <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-computer-programmers-need-to-stop-calling-themselves-engineers-already-2015-11">Why computer
programmers need to stop calling themselves engineers already</a>.
Even if I can&rsquo;t clearly explain how this is related, I have the feeling it&rsquo;s
talking about something that is in the same area.</p>

<h2 id="packaging-a-gem-for-debian:2e8a1de1525658978fef3574497ed77d">Packaging a gem for Debian</h2>

<p>Recently I had to package a gem for debian as a .deb. As a matter of fact,
there is a lot of companies that are not in the ruby ecosystem and they rely
on things they trust rather than rubygems. For a while debian was way behind
on the inclusion of ruby and versions were outdated there. So a parallel
distribution ecosystem had to be created. Now we have rvm, rbenv, or chruby
for ruby and bundler and rubygems for the packages. But where I work, they
package everything as debian packages. So I had to adapt.</p>

<p>So I went have a look at <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Ruby">the debian ruby team</a> and checked out
the tools. That gem2deb tool is pretty convenient. I am using debian for a
while but never really had to package anything. The debian community process
is a bit complicated and they are not very inclusive. Compared to the ease of
uploading any gem to rubygems, it&rsquo;s quite a fortress, and people in the
process are not very welcoming.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s generational. Debian started before sourceforge existed, they are
rooted in a community tradition that are very exclusive and a bit elitist. But
technology changes faster than people, obviously. Younger communities
bootstrap in a more fluid environment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure it is related but maybe it is, there was another epic [Linus
Hit][liushit] recently. Well, all those things put in perspective the niceness
of the ruby community. Really, cherish it and enjoy it, it&rsquo;s precious.</p>

<h2 id="the-power-of-dsl:ab3ba7ed22eeaa19b0cb56ca8c01c80b">The power of DSL</h2>

<p>While I was playing with <a href="https://github.com/zetachang/react.rb">react.rb</a> and exploring <a href="http://opalrb.org/">opal</a>, I
felt in a totally different world. The power of the DSL already prove its
shine on various occasions. I got to experience it in activeadmin, rspec, and
puppet (but I kind of dislike the one in puppet).</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m also writing some python, I can see a real difference in expressibility
that can be found in ruby. Really, ruby is a maker tool. Like a toolbox for
making new programming languages, using meta-programming, lambda and other
goodies. This is what, in my opinion, makes ruby unique. Beyond the elegance
of its syntax, it empowers developers with the ability to write dedicated
programming language for any specific use. And this, I didn&rsquo;t find in python.</p>
