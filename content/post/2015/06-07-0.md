This weekend there was a python conference here in Taipei ([pycon apac][pycon]). 
As Gandi was sponsoring it, I [went there][photos] and tried to
figure out how python and ruby communities differ in my local area. As a
matter of fact, I also push my python coding skills a bit. I kind of like to
nurture a general polyglot approach.

It first seems that the python community is more largely supported by sponsors
than ruby one. It's more mainstream in the general engineering world, I guess.
There was google, facebook, microsoft, having a table and talking about their
cloud things. But the general setup was pretty similar to the ruby or rails
conf I've been in.

The topics in this conference were maybe a little more scientific and less
web-oriented than we can find in ruby world. Python has tighter bindings with
lower level languages. I think it's not a specificity of the language because
you also can build C extensions for ruby. But it's more a result of the
community interests.

I have the feeling that the ruby community dedicated more efforts towards the
web front and other rails related principle like testing suites, DSL and
meta-programming. But my general feeling is that there is no technical reason
for that. It's just how things happened over time, mostly given the weight of
rails in the ruby communities.

Actually, I also had the feeling that pythonists don't consider ruby as a
'competitor'. They feel closer to java, node or golang, and at various
occasion I had the impression that they consider ruby to be only the language
behind rails.

I also thought that the ruby community was special about its adoption of
macbook laptops. Even if actually the python coder has more diversity, I
evaluate around half macbooks, the rest split between ubuntu and windows. It's
less that in ruby confs where macbooks are kinda 90% and windows users are
very few.

Also, I noticed a similar movement about diversity with [django girls][djangogirls] 
and [pyladies][pyladies], comparable to the rails girls,
which tries to close the gender gap in the engineering world.

Anyways that was good and interesting. Geeks are the same kind, whatever
language they use (by trade or by taste). I strongly advise, if you have the
occasion, to wander out of your usual communities and join other circles. It
gives a good perspective on you usual world.
