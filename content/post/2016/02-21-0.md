This week I checked out [The radical plan to destroy timezones][timezoneplan], 
which proposes to adopt UTC worldwide. It goes even
further in proposing a change in our calendar for adopting the [Hanke-Henry
Permanent Calendar][hankehenry]. It's not the first time people propose change
in our western gregorian calendar system (which is almost 500 yearsold), but
it's quite not easy to get anything adopted.
Still, we developers consider Timezones as one of our nightmares. When we get
to our senses we put everything we can in UTC, but there is always the need to
get time 'local' at some point. I have honestly little hope that UTC become
the worldwide standard, but, hey, we always can dream, right?
