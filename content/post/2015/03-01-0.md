## Working abroad

Our craft as webdev is clearly in huge demand. This provides an opportunity
for us to travel abroad, discover new cultures, widen our horizon. When I went
to live in Taiwan, I was not worried about finding a job. But when hunting for
a job abroad it can be tricky to find companies that will sponsor a visa, a
work permit, or whatever legal requirement is involved in each countries.

That's what the new initiative called [TechMeAbroad][1] aims to fix, by
listing only job opportunities for which a work permit is sponsored. As
[Julien Barbier explains][2], it will launch in march, and if you know of any
job offers that includes a visa or such thing, please let him know (or send it
to me I will pass it along), so we can feed that platform with some real data
quickly.

## So long ruby 1.9

As planned, it's now time to say [byebye to ruby 1.9.3][3]. But there is still
so many old version of ruby in the wild. In debian squeeze, you gotta use 1.8.
In wheezy, you have 1.9. And there are still many servers that will refuse to
upgrade.

## Pick your hero

The registration for [Ruby Heroes 2015][4] is now open. Go vote for your
favorite ruby influential dev. You have until [railsconf][5] that will happen
in april, in Atlanta this year.
