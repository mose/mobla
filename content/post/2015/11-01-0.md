## The power of DSL

While I was playing with [react.rb][reactrb] and exploring [opal][opal], I
felt in a totally different world. The power of the DSL already prove its
shine on various occasions. I got to experience it in activeadmin, rspec, and
puppet (but I kind of dislike the one in puppet).

As I'm also writing some python, I can see a real difference in expressibility
that can be found in ruby. Really, ruby is a maker tool. Like a toolbox for
making new programming languages, using meta-programming, lambda and other
goodies. This is what, in my opinion, makes ruby unique. Beyond the elegance
of its syntax, it empowers developers with the ability to write dedicated
programming language for any specific use. And this, I didn't find in python.
