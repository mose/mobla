Because I had some time recently I watched the whole serie of videos of the "Collective Intelligence Conference"
from 2014 on youtube. It's part of my re-exploration of that field, see what changed in the past years.

Well, those were pretty interesting talks but it stroke me that there was a clear amalgam of terms there.
It's related to the english usage of the "intelligence" word. The exact same word in french only means the
capacity to process information and take decisions. This is a human trait, somehow a way to distinguish 
us from the rest of the animal reign.

But in english it also is used by government as "data collection", as in "business intelligence", or
"the intelligence community". In french, we call that "renseignement", so it's a totally separate concept.
So, from my french perspective, I didn't anticipate the impact of this double meaning for the word "intelligence"
while watching talks about "Collective Intelligence".

So there was a lot of talks about crowdsourcing, about new ways to gather information from previously 
untaped sources by the way of massive internet participation. And not that much about the other intelligence
which is about organizing data and structural design of human niteraction.

They held conferences in [2012][ci2012] but the [links to videos][ci2012videos] failed, in [2014][ci214], 
which is the one I found videos for, in [2015][ci2015] found no videos, in [2016][ci2016] videos are in [google drive][ci2016videos]. 
The [2017 edition][ci2017] is just happening right now and I hope there will be videos.

There are a lot of academic papers linked to those talks. Pretty good content.

But what I'm interested in seems to be a very small subset of what is called Collective Intelligence nowadays.
I may need to define the term more explicitely. Let's call it Intentional Collective Intelligence Engineering.
Because as a sopftware developer and a systems architect, what I'm interested in, is building things, designing its cogs,
anticipating its impact on usage and on norms.

While I like collectiing feedback from the users of my solutions, I also know that the numerous choices you do 
when designing a system impact on the usages in very deep ways. And those are not always conscious habits that 
are influenced. But natural forces that drive a group to adopt this or that strategy after having analysed and 
matured its knwoledge of its context.

And I'm pretty convinced that the Collective Intelligence I seek can be engineered. A proper environment, 
set of conventions, incentives and obstacles, can be deliberately designed for the purpose of emergence 
of that collective intelligence.

I have seen glimpses of it happen while participating in open source comunity development. I know there are bricks 
already existing to create various conditions necessary to the emergence. It's not an utopia.
