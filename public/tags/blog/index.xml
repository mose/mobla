&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-blogging:111d43eaf8a2a6adad496f0417e7f52c&#34;&gt;About blogging&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, since that whole blogging thing began, I never have been very active on
it. Well, I have a &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.mose.com&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; on Tumblr because I wanted to know how they
are doing it, I published various posts in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://devtips.faria.co/authors.html#mose-ref&#34;&gt;faria devtips&lt;/a&gt;, and
after all, this rant could also count as a publication. So I think I will
gather them all under one unique site. A Jekyll github-pages kind, easy and
cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure the devtips website will stay up any longer. There
have been no post since the day I left. Too bad. It&amp;rsquo;s a demonstration that
some collective actions can sometimes rely only on the energy of one person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I made a &lt;a href=&#34;http://mose.github.io/blog&#34;&gt;new repo&lt;/a&gt; on github for it, and I will gather whatever
stuff I can find that I wrote in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lovely-freebsd:111d43eaf8a2a6adad496f0417e7f52c&#34;&gt;Lovely FreeBSD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At our Gandi office in Taipei I had to install a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pfsense.org/&#34;&gt;pfsense&lt;/a&gt; server,
which is based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freebsd.org/&#34;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;. It was quite a pleasant experience,
actually. Last time I played a bit with BSD that was 12 years ago, and that
was not very smooth. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to be given that occasion to see how it goes
now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now I&amp;rsquo;m going to use it like if it was an &lt;a href=&#34;https://openwrt.org/&#34;&gt;OpenWRT&lt;/a&gt; with some
extra &lt;a href=&#34;https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source.html&#34;&gt;OpenVPN&lt;/a&gt; abilities. And it will also be a file server for the
LAN. Not sure yet how I will handle that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ruby-package-management:111d43eaf8a2a6adad496f0417e7f52c&#34;&gt;Ruby package management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got in my new job, I discovered a new way to manage server management.
They didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://rvm.io/&#34;&gt;rvm&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href=&#34;https://rubygems.org/&#34;&gt;ruby gems&lt;/a&gt;, or
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/&#34;&gt;pip&lt;/a&gt; or anything that is not debian packages. It may sound quite harsh.
Since I came in ruby in 2010, rvm has been my best friend, bundle the second
one. But this approach is very developer-based. When you maintain large and
stable systems, it&amp;rsquo;s more likely that you will not trust the bleeding edge
stuff and prefer confirmed publication of packages before using them. This is
an interesting slap on my face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there are the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brightbox.com/docs/ruby/ubuntu/&#34;&gt;brightbox&lt;/a&gt; packages for Ubuntu, but that&amp;rsquo;s
missing the point. A release has to be out for a certain time so it can be
strengthened by security reviews and proper production usage. There is a part
of the population for each language that is considering the instability of
current releases a normal trade-off. but there is a huge lot of other
companies that will wait patiently that things get stable enough for their
taste.&lt;/p&gt;
