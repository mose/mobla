Well, since that whole blogging thing began, I never have been very active on
it. Well, I have a [blog][blog] on Tumblr because I wanted to know how they
are doing it, I published various posts in the [faria devtips][devtips], and
after all, this rant could also count as a publication. So I think I will
gather them all under one unique site. A Jekyll github-pages kind, easy and
cheap.

After all, I'm not sure the devtips website will stay up any longer. There
have been no post since the day I left. Too bad. It's a demonstration that
some collective actions can sometimes rely only on the energy of one person.

So, I made a [new repo][newblog] on github for it, and I will gather whatever
stuff I can find that I wrote in there.

## Lovely FreeBSD

At our Gandi office in Taipei I had to install a [pfsense][pfsense] server,
which is based on [FreeBSD][freebsd]. It was quite a pleasant experience,
actually. Last time I played a bit with BSD that was 12 years ago, and that
was not very smooth. I'm happy to be given that occasion to see how it goes
now.

For now I'm going to use it like if it was an [OpenWRT][openwrt] with some
extra [OpenVPN][openvpn] abilities. And it will also be a file server for the
LAN. Not sure yet how I will handle that.

## Ruby package management

When I got in my new job, I discovered a new way to manage server management.
They didn't want to use [rvm][rvm], or even [ruby gems][rubygems], or
[pip][pip] or anything that is not debian packages. It may sound quite harsh.
Since I came in ruby in 2010, rvm has been my best friend, bundle the second
one. But this approach is very developer-based. When you maintain large and
stable systems, it's more likely that you will not trust the bleeding edge
stuff and prefer confirmed publication of packages before using them. This is
an interesting slap on my face.

Of course there are the [brightbox][brightbox] packages for Ubuntu, but that's
missing the point. A release has to be out for a certain time so it can be
strengthened by security reviews and proper production usage. There is a part
of the population for each language that is considering the instability of
current releases a normal trade-off. but there is a huge lot of other
companies that will wait patiently that things get stable enough for their
taste.
