            <div class="post-description">
              

<p>A collection of events occurred since my last post. I was really hoping to
get some deep dive into writing more about collective intelligence, in the background.
But various things came and distracted me from that initial trajectory.</p>

<h2 id="hubot-revival:195c338923f21c367264a5b5fb00e8a9">Hubot revival</h2>

<p>First, there has been a revival of the <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot">Hubot project</a>. I wrote a bunch of
plugins for that chatbot for internal usage at Gandi in the past year. I have been poking
around in the community complaining that it became some sort of abandonware. Issues on github
were not addressed, PR unanswered, irc was silent.</p>

<p>Then one day 3 weeks ago, <a href="https://github.com/bkeepers">bkeepers</a> came up and <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/ROADMAP.md">woke it up</a>.
It appears that now Github has plan for this codebase. They want to include it in its products
more officially, says the rumor (nothing official yet). But it makes a lot of sense.
So then he gathered people that could be involved in the revival of the project. I was
contacted to join the core team. That&rsquo;s what you get by nagging people.</p>

<p>Since then it has been quite great to clean up backlog, re-examine old ideas, help setup
new process and tooling for community gardening. I never get tired to see how informal
communities can shape up and self-organize.</p>

<h2 id="quiting-is-not-a-bad-thing:195c338923f21c367264a5b5fb00e8a9">Quiting is not a bad thing</h2>

<p>Around the same time, I felt inspired by handing my resignation of my current job at Gandi.
There is nothing wrong with the job, and most reasonable people could argue that I&rsquo;m just stupid.
But there are a combination of factors that led me to think I was not using my potential at
full capacity.</p>

<p>Working on a large infrastructure as a sysadmin was great, but it&rsquo;s pretty hard to build new things
properly in the service industry. It&rsquo;s always about contingency management, and reacting to the environment.
It&rsquo;s more about doing the fireman than the gardener. Well, honestly, I think it&rsquo;s a question of intent
and culture and that could have been addressed. But I didn&rsquo;t see any hint that could let me think this
environment would become intentional about gardening anytime soon.</p>

<p>So, out of the blue, I left. I chose a moment where there was no crisis, no trouble, no real reason
to quit except a strong feeling that it was time to move on. That way, transition is painless, there
is no frustration involved. I hate conflicts. My advice: never wait the burn out to make your move out.</p>

<h2 id="green-ruby-end-of-life:195c338923f21c367264a5b5fb00e8a9">Green ruby end of life</h2>

<p>In the mood of transitionning, this week I proposed that we close the <a href="http://greenruby.org">Green Ruby</a> adventure.
For some months Xenor has taken over the publication process. But he&rsquo;s himself bunt out a bit.
So after 4 years of publication, it&rsquo;s time to close this properly and move on.</p>

<p>That weekly links collection was a fun exercise. And I&rsquo;m really happy to have refused any business
side track on this operation, it would have been much harder to close.</p>

<h2 id="what-next:195c338923f21c367264a5b5fb00e8a9">What next?</h2>

<p>I decided that I could stay funemployed for a while (that&rsquo;s the proper term, right?). I&rsquo;m planning
to look around, play with techs, talk with friends, hold on any decision to engage in anything.
It&rsquo;s time to re-assess my roadmap. This is what is great in transitions.
By losing contact with the ground, you can feel the direction of the wind.</p>

<p>Maybe I will get back to entrepreneurship, and setup some business venture. Maybe I will freelance for a while.
Maybe I will find a context in a company where I feel comfortable contributing. But honestly I have no clue.
And yet, this feels great.</p>

<h2 id="getting-back-to-old-friends:195c338923f21c367264a5b5fb00e8a9">Getting back to old friends</h2>

<p>In the first days after my decision to renounce my day job, I got back in contact with a lot of old friends.
Transitions have that side effect that you have to re-evaluate your environment, your network, your values.</p>

<p>Getting into a full-time job doesn&rsquo;t prevent that, of course, but you cannot give the same attention.
The center of gravity of an employed person is static. Now that I&rsquo;m floating, I have to dedicate much more
attention to my environment. And it&rsquo;s an excellent thing.</p>

<p>I will certainly have occasion to talk about my adventures very soon. Maybe I will force myself to write more.</p>

            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              

<p>I plan to share some thoughts about Collective Intelligence from a software perspective.
But this comes from an old story that I thought I should make public first.</p>

<h2 id="the-origins:ea7330696100fc7495594863651b3c82">The origins</h2>

<p>When I first began to program web applications, it was mostly for my own needs
as an activist (freedom of speech on internet, cryptography, and such matters).
Around 1998 I had a fully working solution called &lsquo;Collaborative writer&rsquo; or
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cwriter/">cWriter</a> for short, written in PHP. It was like a sort of wiki geared towards
small groups self-organization.</p>

<p>When I got to Claranet I deployed it as an internal solution, and worked on a
full company intranet called &lsquo;in&rsquo;. It was the occasion to release cWriter as
open source in 2000 on Sourceforge.</p>

<p>At that time it appeared obvious that my area of preference was about engineering
collaborative work. I was putting a lot of thoughts into that. I had this clear
understanding that the tool shapes the usages, especially in this new realm that
was internet communication.</p>

<p>Later on, I dedicated my time in various projects, mostly <a href="https://tiki.org/mose">Tikiwiki groupware</a> in 2003.
That experience was also rich in valuable experiments. I became leader in that community
because being unemployed at that time, I took the occasion to just invest time in
open source (being payed by labor insurance money). And I was just very prolific.
I established various bases for that community that still thrives today. I had a
<a href="https://tiki.org/Webinar+2012+10">recorded interview</a> with the guys for the 10 years for the project in 2012.</p>

<h2 id="the-discovery:ea7330696100fc7495594863651b3c82">The discovery</h2>

<p>Somewhere in 2004 I met with <a href="http://noubel.com/">JF Noubel</a>, that had some need for help on his own Tikiwiki
instance, called thetransitionner.org. His website (not available anymore nowadays)
was dedicated to promotion and exploration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence">Collective Intelligence</a>, following the work,
among others, of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_L%C3%A9vy">Pierre Lévy</a>.</p>

<p>I quickly identified this area of research as something that I was practicing and
aiming at, without having formally identified it. So I got more and more interested
into that field in the following years.</p>

<p>Jean-Francois became a friend, his approach evolved since then but I still got stuck with
his <a href="http://publishing.yudu.com/Library/Arswi/CollectiveIntelligen/resources/index.htm?skipFlashCheck=true">original presentation</a> describing the basics of Collective Intelligence.</p>

<p>Anyways it led me to some other kind of activism, revolving around some alternative currency
projects (like <a href="http://openmoney.org/">openmoney</a>), other projects concerning governance (like democracy 2.0,
from Mikael Nordfors cited in the <a href="https://archive.org/stream/eo_Collective_Intelligence/Collective_Intelligence_djvu.txt">transcript on archive.org</a>), and various other topics
that would be too long to list here.</p>

<p>Ultimately it led to get involved in <a href="http://angenius.org/tiki-index.php">Angenius</a> with <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanh_Nghiem">Than Nghiem</a> in a background of
sustainable development between 2006 and 2008. Including going to live in a farm in Normandy.
Which was amazing but I was just not made for it.</p>

<h2 id="the-migration:ea7330696100fc7495594863651b3c82">The migration</h2>

<p>In 2008 I decided to leave France and go live in Taiwan. I wanted to take a break and
learn Chinese. It was my decision for my 40th birthday. Since then I got various jobs in
development and then in system administration, grinding more programming languages and
technical skills. But I still kept all this time the background thinking on
collective intelligence.</p>

<p>What I wanted to experience was just another cultural background. I wanted to see patterns
a little better about open source communities and collaborative work in a different context.
Well. This could be the topic for another post. I got some surprises.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-next:ea7330696100fc7495594863651b3c82">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>

<p>Now, 9 years after, I feel it&rsquo;s more than time I get back to my past ventures. Well,
I didn&rsquo;t live like an hermit, I&rsquo;m involved in various local and global communities.
But I feel I could share a little more about what I learned in my past experiments.
Now that I reach my 50&rsquo;s, maybe I just feel like I have to begin writing stuff.</p>
