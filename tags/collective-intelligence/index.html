<p>I plan to share some thoughts about Collective Intelligence from a software perspective.
But this comes from an old story that I thought I should make public first.</p>

<h2 id="the-origins:ea7330696100fc7495594863651b3c82">The origins</h2>

<p>When I first began to program web applications, it was mostly for my own needs
as an activist (freedom of speech on internet, cryptography, and such matters).
Around 1998 I had a fully working solution called &lsquo;Collaborative writer&rsquo; or
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cwriter/">cWriter</a> for short, written in PHP. It was like a sort of wiki geared towards
small groups self-organization.</p>

<p>When I got to Claranet I deployed it as an internal solution, and worked on a
full company intranet called &lsquo;in&rsquo;. It was the occasion to release cWriter as
open source in 2000 on Sourceforge.</p>

<p>At that time it appeared obvious that my area of preference was about engineering
collaborative work. I was putting a lot of thoughts into that. I had this clear
understanding that the tool shapes the usages, especially in this new realm that
was internet communication.</p>

<p>Later on, I dedicated my time in various projects, mostly <a href="https://tiki.org/mose">Tikiwiki groupware</a> in 2003.
That experience was also rich in valuable experiments. I became leader in that community
because being unemployed at that time, I took the occasion to just invest time in
open source (being payed by labor insurance money). And I was just very prolific.
I established various bases for that community that still thrives today. I had a
<a href="https://tiki.org/Webinar+2012+10">recorded interview</a> with the guys for the 10 years for the project in 2012.</p>

<h2 id="the-discovery:ea7330696100fc7495594863651b3c82">The discovery</h2>

<p>Somewhere in 2004 I met with <a href="http://noubel.com/">JF Noubel</a>, that had some need for help on his own Tikiwiki
instance, called thetransitionner.org. His website (not available anymore nowadays)
was dedicated to promotion and exploration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence">Collective Intelligence</a>, following the work,
among others, of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_L%C3%A9vy">Pierre LÃ©vy</a>.</p>

<p>I quickly identified this area of research as something that I was practicing and
aiming at, without having formally identified it. So I got more and more interested
into that field in the following years.</p>

<p>Jean-Francois became a friend, his approach evolved since then but I still got stuck with
his <a href="http://publishing.yudu.com/Library/Arswi/CollectiveIntelligen/resources/index.htm?skipFlashCheck=true">original presentation</a> describing the basics of Collective Intelligence.</p>

<p>Anyways it led me to some other kind of activism, revolving around some alternative currency
projects (like <a href="http://openmoney.org/">openmoney</a>), other projects concerning governance (like democracy 2.0,
from Mikael Nordfors cited in the <a href="https://archive.org/stream/eo_Collective_Intelligence/Collective_Intelligence_djvu.txt">transcript on archive.org</a>), and various other topics
that would be too long to list here.</p>

<p>Ultimately it led to get involved in <a href="http://angenius.org/tiki-index.php">Angenius</a> with <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanh_Nghiem">Than Nghiem</a> in a background of
sustainable development between 2006 and 2008. Including going to live in a farm in Normandy.
Which was amazing but I was just not made for it.</p>

<h2 id="the-migration:ea7330696100fc7495594863651b3c82">The migration</h2>

<p>In 2008 I decided to leave France and go live in Taiwan. I wanted to take a break and
learn Chinese. It was my decision for my 40th birthday. Since then I got various jobs in
development and then in system administration, grinding more programming languages and
technical skills. But I still kept all this time the background thinking on
collective intelligence.</p>

<p>What I wanted to experience was just another cultural background. I wanted to see patterns
a little better about open source communities and collaborative work in a different context.
Well. This could be the topic for another post. I got some surprises.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-next:ea7330696100fc7495594863651b3c82">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>

<p>Now, 9 years after, I feel it&rsquo;s more than time I get back to my past ventures. Well,
I didn&rsquo;t live like an hermit, I&rsquo;m involved in various local and global communities.
But I feel I could share a little more about what I learned in my past experiments.
Now that I reach my 50&rsquo;s, maybe I just feel like I have to begin writing stuff.</p>
