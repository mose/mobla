      <title>Moving to Hugo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I love website pre-generation concept I have been using &lt;a href=&#34;http://jekyllrb.com&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://octopress.org&#34;&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt; quite a lot. But now I wanted to give a try to &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I have had various spaces of blogging in the past few years, so I thought I should just recenter everything in a unique place. There was an old blog on tumblr because I wanted to see how it was made. Then I had a period of time where I was publishing tips on the Faria Devtips website, which is down now. Then I also publish some rants every week on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://greenruby.org&#34;&gt;Greenruby&lt;/a&gt; newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only the last on is still active, so I will cross-post things from there to here, which should not be too hard as they are both markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first impression of Hugo is that there are still a lot of small weird things. But in some ways, I&amp;rsquo;m kind of happy about it, I guess I will try to fix some of those, that will be an occasion to play a little with golang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;just-met-hugo:7f9ce9f83e9126826117a493b10fad98&#34;&gt;Just met Hugo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some weeks ago I was talking about Octopress. I think pre-generation of
websites is a very sensible approach. And I heard about &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; for some
time now. It&amp;rsquo;s like a cousin of Jekyll but writen in Go. The author of
Middleman (another site generation engine) confessed in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://changelog.com/169/&#34;&gt;recent podcast&lt;/a&gt;
that he would try the Golang way if he had to start from
scratch today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got interested into Hugo mostly because one of the side projects I&amp;rsquo;m working
on. It involves a bunch of people that run on windows. Having a binary that
runs everywhere is a big plus for a gGo solution. Installing ruby is possible
on windows, but not really for noobs afaict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I want to check more Go projects. I have been playing in and out that
language for a while now. Version 1.5 seems really great. So I upgraded my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/moovweb/gvm&#34;&gt;gvm&lt;/a&gt; and installed the thing. Well, I could havce just used the Hugo
binary, but where is the fun in that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first impression is very comfortable. It took a lot of the principles form
Jekyll. But it seems to have some extra options and concepts that may be a
little more advanced and seem very promising. The theming system is especially
cool. I will probably first port my own blog under Hugo before porting my
other project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, that&amp;rsquo;s a while I&amp;rsquo;m considering that I never feed my blog,
but I should copy the rants I write here in there. It can be fun to add a rake
task in the greenruby publication process to also add a page in a nearby hugo
repo and publish it at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
