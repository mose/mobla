Recently Gandi moved to a much bigger office in Neihu, Taipei. And I got
permission to use the space to organize events. We got a great space, sound
system with wireless mikes, a beamer for presentations. So, if you are in
Taipei, feel free to [join us on wednesday next week][grg001].  I will try to
make it a remote meetup, and give more details next week.
