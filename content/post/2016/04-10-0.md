## Go again

That's years that I'm trying to do something real with go. I mean, it is a
very attractive language with quite a special workflow and toolbox. From time
to time I write some small script for keeping contact with that language. Last
week I made [this one][slackpin] to list links pinned in our Greenruby
slackroom to prepare the letter, So I can open them all at once to check them
in my browser. With time passing, seems that Go now has a really complete
collection of libraries for a lot of usages. I think I will have push a little
the slack api soon, and maybe do some real go coding.
