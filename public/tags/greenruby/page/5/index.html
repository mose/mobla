<h2 id="dst-sucks:30c8323f12e415f49a8e753e970d1ab8">DST sucks</h2>

<p>This week-end they changed time in France. As I work with those guys to cover
the watching of servers, then I need to change time too. This is totally lame.
In the context of largely distributed teams, DST is heresy. It happens in the
US too, but not even at the same time. Man I hate DST. I&rsquo;m happy we don&rsquo;t have
that in Taiwan.</p>

<h2 id="thunderbird-sucks-too:30c8323f12e415f49a8e753e970d1ab8">Thunderbird sucks too</h2>

<p>Despite the respect I have for mozilla products and for their efforts toward
the community, I have to say that I have been using thunderbird for a while
and I don&rsquo;t like it. There is some lack of customability in there, it eats a
whole lot of memory and it&rsquo;s kinda slow sometimes. I have been considering
getting back to mutt, which is a totally different category of mail client.</p>

<p>But I found <a href="http://www.claws-mail.org/">claws</a>, and trying it for a few days on my various
mailboxes with hundreds of thousands of mails, and it is a very good feeling.
It&rsquo;s much more transparent and hackable and stays in the same category of the
clickable mail client as thunderbird. I&rsquo;m not sure I will stick to claws,
maybe I will get back to mutt that I have been used so many years before. But
I sure will give that &lsquo;email client that bites&rsquo; a try for a while.</p>

<h2 id="gmail-sucks-more:30c8323f12e415f49a8e753e970d1ab8">Gmail sucks more</h2>

<p>I still can&rsquo;t figure out why people use gmail for reading their mail. I mean,
you leave management of your mail to google, you know what they do with it.
You also want to give them information about how you read your mail? I mean,
using a webmail, first, should be a fallback. But it&rsquo;s mystery for nobody that
google business is in profiling people. It blasts me how people can trust them
blindly.</p>

<h2 id="slack-overflow:94c85cedf808f313200328bd388deb80">Slack overflow</h2>

<p>Okay I reckon I&rsquo;m very old school. I began on the net with irc and I still stick to it. I have been confused by the trend that make people use Twitter like if it was some kind of real-time interactive medium. I have watched skype becoming unavoidable, and despicable. I hope <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> will kill it, honestly.</p>

<p>I have been using hipchat and slack for work. Hipchat was really cool, but slack came later on and seemed more modern and featurefull. But it didn&rsquo;t have a linux client for a while. So I didn&rsquo;t really played much with it. But now there is a linux client, and it seems that there is an ecosystem nuilding up around slack. As they don&rsquo;t charge for normal usage until you need many integrations with various services, it&rsquo;s pretty easy for anyone to create some new slack team.</p>

<p>Slack was first designed for teams, and those teams are gathered by invite only. But there are many ways to smooth it up to create some open discussion area that could be compared to irc. But in a way that it includes features that on irc I had to settle myself. For example for sharing code on irc you typically use some pastebin, jsfiddle, or other service of the same kind. In slack code can be pasted in directly or uploaded as a file. For keeping some kind of permanence I always use weechat in a screen on a remote server. That way I never disconnect form irc and I can backlog when I get back. But this is not for everybody and slack has the same kind of feature. But the most noticeable feature in slack is the mobile integration. It beats irc without a doubt.</p>

<p>Given those benefits, various communities begin to switch from irc to slack. There are even people building up a business creating communities on slack. Check <a href="http://www.slacklist.info/">slacklist</a> or the <a href="http://chats.directory/">chat directory</a>. Some of those slack teams are open, some others are accessible after a review process, some others you have to pay a fee to access them.</p>

<p>I would not say that slack replaces irc, to be honest, even if it fulfills some similar goal. It&rsquo;s a totally different beast. Plus, that&rsquo;s a third party that keeps all your logs. If security of your content is an issue, you should rather have an internal irc server or try an open source self-hosted slack alternative.</p>

<p>Currently I got 6 groups on my slack client, including the <a href="https://greenruby.slack.com/">Greenruby slack group</a>. You can ask for an invite at <a href="mailto:news@greenruby.org">slack@greenruby.org</a> it&rsquo;s totally open.</p>

<h2 id="rubyconf-tw:6a0e12fe1d32b33b0719139f3561d417">Rubyconf TW</h2>

<p>So these last 2 days we went to RubyConfTW here in Taipei, like every year. At
that occasion I kinda forced my buddies to take part in this rant section. So,
that occasion of meeting the ruby community was as usual very enjoyable. Year
after year we see the same people, the community is solid and persistent.</p>

<p>Like last years Matz was here and he talked about ruby 3 and, that was a
surprise to me, he talked about getting rid of the GIL very soon. That GIL
topic has been a taboo for so many years. Getting rid off it can change the
position of ruby in the family of the major scripting languages. He also
defined laziness as one of the 3 required characteristics of a good coder. I&rsquo;m
not sure there is anything mainstream about those 3 qualities but for a long
time I had my set of 3 requirements to evaluate a good coder and laziness was
in it. maybe I will develop more about it in another rant.</p>

<p>During this conference I also had the occasion to hear a lot of direct
feedback from friends of Green Ruby. For example we have an irc channel but
many people are not that comfortable with that chat system from another
century and would prefer a slack room. As a matter of fact we have such a
room, but we forgot about it for the past year. It&rsquo;s alive again, feel free to
send a request for invite to news at greenruby.org to join
<a href="http://greenruby.slack.com">http://greenruby.slack.com</a>. It&rsquo;s open to everybody.</p>

<h2 id="rubyconftw-by-xenor:6a0e12fe1d32b33b0719139f3561d417">Rubyconftw by xenor</h2>

<p>Hey I&rsquo;m xenor and this is my first rant in Green Ruby News about (and not
about) <a href="http://2015.rubyconf.tw/">rubyconftw</a>.</p>

<p>I work in a ruby shop and manage a couple of people, and I am recently feeling
burned-out. It affects motivation and productivity. I am in a position which
involves watching over colleagues output. But I also have my own coding
projects ongoing.</p>

<p>At first it&rsquo;s great and challenging. But after half a year, it starts to bite
me back. I get tired and anxious about not meeting my goal at the end of the
day while checking others progress. I also need more breaks than usual. The
typical burn-out syndrome.</p>

<p>Rubyconf gave me a break so that I can rethink what I was doing and how I can
evaluate things around me. During the conference, I found some time to do
<a href="https://github.com/tubaxenor/squeezer">side project</a>. This really helps and re-motivates me on programming
(I believe this could be called &lsquo;Conference Driven Development&rsquo;)</p>

<p>You might wonder why I didn&rsquo;t say anything about the talks. Actually, talks
are just as great as all other conferences, and can be watched on the
recordings that they will post soon. But the most important part is really the
atmosphere of encouragement to try and learn something new.</p>

<h2 id="rubyconftw-by-tysliu:6a0e12fe1d32b33b0719139f3561d417">Rubyconftw by tysliu</h2>

<p>Greetings. This is tysliu and this is also my first rant and my experience
from going to 2015 Rubyconf TW.</p>

<p>The main benefit from attending rubyconf this year is that I said hello to
more people. I met past colleagues and also new people. It feels nice to see
familiar faces and catch up.</p>

<p>The most interesting talk for me this years was tenderlove&rsquo;s talk. It was
about how he attacked the issue of making Rails HTTP2 friendly. Basically,
Rails at the moment is not http2 compatible. This is due the the current
architecture of Rails and implementation of rack middlewares. During the talk
he was able to demo a prototype Rails that is H2 friendly.</p>

<p>The best news for Rails developers is that there are plans to for making HTTP
2 compatibility available in Rails 5.</p>

<h2 id="meet-at-rubyconf:5c5ed19a98630bcf79414a52c93d484e">Meet at rubyconf</h2>

<p>Next friday we will be at <a href="http://2015.rubyconf.tw/">rubyconf Taiwan</a>. Last year there was
around 300 attendees and there is 256 this year. But maybe there will be more
last minute registration, there is still some <a href="http://rubytaiwan.kktix.cc/events/rubyconftw2015">spots available</a> (well
just 14 at this time). I will also be at the <a href="http://rubytaiwan.kktix.cc/events/850d36b0">pre-conf evening</a> on
wednesday. Good time to meet if you are in Taiwan (we have 37 subscribers
there).</p>

<h2 id="some-stats-on-greenruby:5c5ed19a98630bcf79414a52c93d484e">Some stats on greenruby</h2>

<p>From time to time I check an export of the subscribers list and do some stats
out of curiosity. As of today there are 1466 subscribers, and more than half
in the US (844) all the rest are in 88 other countries (most in India, UK,
France and Taiwan, in that order). In the US most people are from New-York,
just a little more than Los Angeles, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monticello,_Kentucky">Monticello</a> in Kentucky.
I wonder what there is so special in that city of less than 10k people. Maybe
that&rsquo;s a geo-location glitch? If not, please someone tell me what there is in
that small and probably nice city. But if I had to bet, I would put my money
on the glitch.</p>

<p>Every week there is a small number of new subscribers, especially during
summer. But if you don&rsquo;t really read or if you don&rsquo;t care that much, please
unsubscribe. I will certainly have to do some invitation to unsubscribe when
we will reach around 2000, because mailchimp if free of charge only under that
limit.</p>

<p>There are also a lot of unaccounted subscribers to the RSS feed, which is the
most popular page on the website. But I don&rsquo;t use feedburner or any kind of
tracking so I don&rsquo;t really know. And I kind of like it that way.</p>

<h2 id="back-on-tweeting:7ae99486640ad70a650c6bd616a3b6cb">Back on tweeting</h2>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t like my phone. As an old timer I&rsquo;m reluctant to trust my
android, but it would be the same on an iphone. The way applications require
access to the device, on android, is especially annoying and dishonest. They
make the slope slippery for the sake of saving seconds in adopting new apps,
but it&rsquo;s leading to a total remission of users control over their devices.</p>

<p>But well, I still have a commute several times a week and I use my phone to
listen to various podcasts. But I recently configured some accounts and some
news readers, so I also can just do some links curation along the way. So I
suspect there will be more tweeting on the <a href="https://twitter.com/greenrubist">greenrubist</a> account from
now on. It helps quite a lot when I want to gather links on every sundays.</p>

<p>Well, nowadays, most of the links are actually gathered by xenor and tysliu,
but I always add a few on my own (especially the devops ones). Those 2 guys
are really doing an amazing demonstration of consistency. After 129 editions,
we still didn&rsquo;t miss a single one week in our publication. It would not have
been possible without my buddies. Thanks so much for their contribution.</p>

<h2 id="letter-process-and-numbers:83d19966174428ef802df4954f70730e">Letter process and numbers</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s a few weeks now that we are getting organized better, with Xenor and
Tysliu, on the preparation of this newsletter. The guys are now putting more
attention to the news gathering and preformatting the <a href="https://github.com/greenruby/grn-static/blob/master/newsletters/grn.yml">yaml source file</a>
that I use to generate the letter and the website. After
some time of practice, it is much better for me, as now I don&rsquo;t spend 5 hours
each sunday anymore and I can manage the publication process in less than 2
hours. I still gather some extra links after the editors push their
contributions. Then I verify the links, the categories, edit the comments
sometimes, add dots at the ends of line, such tiny things. A huge thanks to
Xenor and Tysliu!</p>

<p>Now we have 1312 subscribers to the newsletter. Plus an unknown number of RSS
subscribers, maybe around 200. We get 250 visits per day on the website
(according to webalizer), and most of them come from rss readers of many
sorts. As the mailchimp is still free until we reach 2000, there is some
margin. When we reach 1600 I think I swill begin a cleaning campaign, to help
people that actually don&rsquo;t read the letter to unsubscribe. I kind of like the
idea of throwing accounts away. Usually in web business, an account is an
asset and they are never thrown away. There is so much to be told about
numbers, and their reality, in our industry.</p>

<p>But the reality about numbers is usually the consequence of the over
simplification required by marketeers. Things are never so simple as just a
single number. The technicians among us are always in pain when we need to
provide numbers, because they come with a strict definition of what they
count, and that definition is never respected by the people that just want to
use the number and put a sexy label on it. When we say &lsquo;registered accounts&rsquo;
they say &lsquo;users&rsquo;. Do you see the difference? Damn, I hate that system that
forces salesmen to become a liars.</p>

<h2 id="green-ruby-new-generation:e04937da80b109c53cab9bf63b0a6b99">Green Ruby New Generation</h2>

<p>We had this week a very productive meeting with xenor and tysliu in our
preferred coffee shop. I explained more in detail my workflow and my quality
criterias. So now they can feed the links section and become the major editors
of Green Ruby. I Still keep the role of the publisher. I get their links, I
clean up stuff, verify freshness and reachability, remove superlatives, fix
category if needed.</p>

<p>Special thanks a lot to Xenor and Tysliu (aka. Simon). Now they do the heavy
lifting and they are the reason why Green Ruby is still in your mailbox every
week.</p>

<h2 id="time-to-upgrade:d4567cfa55308712270d1f5b73098130">Time to upgrade</h2>

<p>This is a long time I plan to re-engineer the way Green Ruby is produced. Last
week I told Xenor and Simon I was thinking about giving it a break. I&rsquo;m not
that much anymore in the flow. Now my days are full ops and not that much dev.
But the guys didn&rsquo;t want to let me stop.</p>

<p>So we are going to organize things a little differently. Xenor and Simon,
which are full time rails developers, are going to handle the content more
extensively, and I will just manage the publication, plus some devops links.
So we need to get some tools ready to handle that new flow. Maybe, the time it
gets ready, we will take some time off. Maybe not.</p>

<p>What I wish is to have a way to let more people jump in, too. Maybe we will
get inspiration in how <a href="http://thechangelog.com/trello-as-a-cms/">the changelog</a> manages their news
flow. They based it on a <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> and it&rsquo;s quite clever. By chance I
explored the trello API recently and I can tell it&rsquo;s really good, very
suitable for custom automation.</p>

<p>This week, I will play lazy on the podcasts. I don&rsquo;t think they are that much
interesting anyways, and all that copy-pasting is exhausting. When some
podcasts stands out of the crowd, I will rather feature it in this rant.</p>

<h2 id="ghost:fba0bb1f68d1414085590cced7805ffa">Ghost</h2>

<p>You certainly heard about it, this week there was a new huge Linux
<a href="http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/01/27/9">vulnerability on glibc</a> revealed. Actually it was leaked by a stupid
communication agency few hours before it should have been announced. When such
big bug is discovered usually there is a small period of time where the news
spread into some limited circles. They keep it embargoed until major distro
vendors get patched packages ready. Well, it didn&rsquo;t go that well this time.</p>

<p>This vulnerability is pretty nasty even if less obvious to exploit than
Heartbleed or shellshock, it&rsquo;s probably in the same category. If you manage
servers that are vulnerable (LTS and stable, less up to date versions,
mostly), you better upgrade asap. When a bug gets its own name (this one is
called Ghost), it seems to be the sign it requires immediate attention. How
long is this trick going to work?</p>

<p>And, as we talk about security, Hipchat users should read this (unnamed)

<h2 id="2-years:fba0bb1f68d1414085590cced7805ffa">2 years</h2>

<p>This edition is marking the 2 years anniversary of Green Ruby. For 104 weeks
I&rsquo;ve been sending out this newsletter every week. Last week I had a discussion
with a friend, he was asking me what was my drive, and what was the reason of
my consistency. Well, there are various reasons.</p>

<p>First there is the routine aspect. It&rsquo;s like practicing Taichi or some kind of
exercise. It keeps the mind fresh, and in this context where things change
pretty fast, enforcing a weekly review gave me an overall feeling of symbiosis
with the wave of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>Second is the philosophy of it: this newsletter is a gift. The ruby world is
very business oriented. There is a lot of open source in there but still the
average spirit is based on a market economy. There are of course many
exceptions, I wanted to be one of them, and I believe a gift economy would be
more my thing. You get rich of what you give away, not always individually,
but most definitely collectively. I like that feeling.</p>

<p>Third, this media keeps me in touch with a bunch of my friends. It&rsquo;s like a
beacon that I send to the people I left behind when I left France to go live
in Taiwan. Or people I worked with in my past jobs in Taiwan, even. They don&rsquo;t
often respond to it but I know they can perceive me through this weekly proof
of existence.</p>

<p>Also, there is the support from xenor and more recently from simon, which, by
sending me a few links each weeks, validate the need to keep things going.</p>

<h2 id="trello-and-irc:fba0bb1f68d1414085590cced7805ffa">Trello and irc</h2>

<p>For as long as I remember, I always have been coding irc bots. In so many
languages. I suspect there is some aspect of this that appeals to me. Maybe
the creation of life-like pattern. Anyways, my last bot was of course in ruby,
I called it <a href="https://github.com/mose/cogbot">cogbot</a>, and is based on the great <a href="https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch">cinch</a> framework. It has
been sleepy for a while, since we were not using irc in Faria.</p>

<p>But Gandi is heavy irc user, and our recent experiments on trello gave me an
occasion to get cogbot out of the dust. As a matter of fact <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> has a
really <a href="https://trello.com/docs/">great API</a>, and also supports webhooks. So I added a trello
listener to cogbot, and it was a lot of fun. Maybe next I will add some cards
creation and update features in that bot, but it requires some kind of users
management, which, on an irc bot, is not that trivial to implement.</p>

<h2 id="free-your-code:fba0bb1f68d1414085590cced7805ffa">Free your code</h2>

<p>Do you have a side project? You should! Maybe the code you produce at work can
be generic enough? This is a call for you to consider freeing your code. Open
source community is plentiful but I know as a fact that 90% of the code that
could be shared is not shared.</p>

<p>There is something I noticed in my own code publication. Often in my work
there are constraints of time that lead to trade-offs and code quality is
never as good as I wish it was. By working on side projects, the pace is much
more relaxed and I can spend hours focusing on non productive efforts to make
my code better. Well, this is not to say that side project code is perfect,
but the environment of producing it brings another mindset. And after a while,
the code produced at work gets naturally more insightful because of this extra
practice.</p>

<p>Give it a try, if you happen to have some free time. If you don&rsquo;t have free
time, you&rsquo;re doing something wrong. But that&rsquo;s another story.</p>

<h2 id="1000-subscribers:dfd863a69df72c13bbe5f0b5d11c54ce">1000 subscribers</h2>

<p>After the 100th Greenruby last week, we get the 1000th subscriber to the email
newsletter this week. Welcome George :) So for the occasion I refreshed the
<a href="http://mose.cartodb.com/viz/6a4d431e-d6b7-11e3-8757-0e10bcd91c2b/embed_map">subscribers map</a> on cartodb. About half of the subscribers are in the US,
but there is a total of 73 countries represented, which is pretty neat. But
this is based on the ip used for subscribing, so it&rsquo;s not totally accurate.</p>

<h2 id="fighting-logs-pollution:dfd863a69df72c13bbe5f0b5d11c54ce">Fighting logs pollution</h2>

<p>Some time ago, on edition 82, I posted a link to my webalizer stats for the
greenruby website. Fatal mistake, I had referrers stats enabled and I got
somehow listed somewhere. The consequence was a lot of fake traffic with only
purpose to get links listed in my referrers section. After removing this
section from webalizer config, and moving the url, the fake traffic was still
there. Like a blind wave. This was pretty annoying.</p>

<p>So I began to take some drastic measures. Because I didn&rsquo;t have referrers
anymore in my stats, I went to my apache logs (yes it&rsquo;s an old server, still
running apache2) and fire up a:</p>

<pre><code>tail -5000 greenruby.org-access.log | cut -d' ' -f11 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
</code></pre>

<p>This give me a nice view of the recent referrers. Fake ones are easy to
notice. And that the fake traffic was only coming from a handful of ips, so I
just made a few:</p>

<pre><code>iptables -A INPUT -s &lt;ip&gt; -j DROP
</code></pre>

<p>The result was radically efficient. Certainly I had less volume but it&rsquo;s now
much cleaner. But it makes it clear that having clean volume stats for traffic
on your website is not that easy. There are a bunch of fake traffic sources
that you may not suspect.</p>

<h2 id="new-server-soon:dfd863a69df72c13bbe5f0b5d11c54ce">New server soon</h2>

<p>I got a new job 2 month ago at <a href="http://gandi.net">gandi</a>, and there is some nice <a href="https://www.gandi.net/hosting/iaas">VPS
hosting</a> there. I can have a machine just for Green Ruby there. It can be
neat and open some options. Green Ruby website is still very static. Various
attempts to improve it with a search engine didn&rsquo;t end up to something
concluding yet. Maybe this time it will.</p>

<p>That also may be the occasion to build up a distribution system and move out
of mailchimp. I looked around and all I found was php based. So I will
probably just write my own ruby scripts, the <a href="https://github.com/mikel/mail">mail gem</a> looks great and the
rest is a question of configuring a postfix with correct <a href="http://www.linuxlasse.net/linux/howtos/Postfix_with_DKIM_%28OpenDKIM%29_and_SPF">SPF and DKIM
setup</a>.</p>

<h2 id="je-suis-charlie:dfd863a69df72c13bbe5f0b5d11c54ce">Je suis Charlie</h2>

<p>Well, this tragedy that happened this Thursday in France impacts a lot of
people. Somehow, it perhaps impacts me more than the average. When I was
younger I went to art school to become a cartoonist, and finally I changed my
mind. But I knew the work of the victims of this slaughter. They were icons in
the French cartoon world.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really sad, first because this is murder, second because the irrational
impact it will have on society. This is crazy how a handful of brain-dead
punks can bend history. Now France is going to become even more paranoid. I
already was so uncomfortable when they began to send military with assault
rifles wander in the train stations in Paris. It&rsquo;s not going to get better.</p>
