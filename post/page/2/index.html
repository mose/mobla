              <p>Great occasion to kick thunderbird byebye and spend some time on configuring
my mutt to make it real again, after 6 years of click-click for mail. I was a
mutt user for a very long time, and my pause for trying a GUI mail client just
had to have an end. But the mail has clearly become something else now.
Actually much more volume, but much more automated things, and news feeds. Or
it&rsquo;s just me?</p>

            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>Next friday, I&rsquo;ve been told that I have to stop working for 2 weeks. Well, for
people that have a normal life and/or kids, it&rsquo;s a pretty good news. For
people that get heavy pressure from their work, it can give some air. But I
wondered why I didn&rsquo;t feel like I ever felt the need for holidays. I take them
by principle, but I&rsquo;m usually not really eager to get them.</p>

<p>After some consideration, it all sums up to some kind of discipline. I refuse
stress on a daily basis. I want each day at work to be enjoyable and
debt-free. It&rsquo;s a bad news for some category of employers. The same way those
consider it&rsquo;s acceptable to accumulate technical debt, they apply the same
principle on human-life debt. Put people under pressure, get a loan on their
health, that will never be repaid. So, I just refuse pressure, the same way I
would refuse to eat meat if I was really vegetarian (which I am only
part-time).</p>

<p>Really I have more trouble with holidays because they bring a gap in the
continuity of work. You get back and there is a lot to catch up on. I would
prefer to have just one hour work less per day than week-long breaks. But
that&rsquo;s just me. It would be totally different if I wanted to travel for fun or
if I had kids. My case is not reproducible.</p>

<p>But the baseline remains valid. whether you have plans or not for holidays,
they should not be required for having a balanced life. Stress has to be
fought on a daily basis and not by using breaks. Breaks, in such case, are
even more enjoyable, if you have the context for it.</p>

<p>The best way I know to push stress away is to put my efforts into what I do,
in a way that I&rsquo;m self-aware that I&rsquo;m really doing what I can to fulfill my
duties. If someone is not happy about the output, that&rsquo;s their problem not
mine. If it leads to some awkward context, then it&rsquo;s broken and I will reach
out to find a better work context. I apply that principle for more than 20
years now and I can&rsquo;t remember last time I felt stressed.</p>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>In my review this week I read that <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2016/09/14/Old-Geek">Old Geek post</a>, which has a lot
of comments under its feet. This is quite interesting. But I feel there is a
confusion here.</p>

<p>From my experience, age is often related to stagnation. The more you
accumulate, the heavier you are. It&rsquo;s heart-breaking to abandon years of
investment in one type of knowledge. Therefore, generally speaking, older
people are less flexible and less likely to surf on the waves of the new
technologies.</p>

<p>But I can tell you as a fact that this is just a natural human law, that, like
many others, can be bended. Bended by discipline, the same way we overcome our
animal instincts. There are many old practitioners of our skill that became
master in the art of change. The sacred art of eternal learning. The wisdom of
daily questioning of previously acquired knowledge.</p>

<p>Obsolescence is not a question of age, but just a question of personality,
environment and priorities. I know a handful of such oldgeeks that didn&rsquo;t yet
reach their 30&rsquo;s. And personally (in my 49), I won&rsquo;t stop surfing any time
soon. hahaha.</p>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>This is a word I love. I found it again in a <a href="https://medium.com/production-ready/systems-blindness-and-how-we-deal-with-it-d601fa63b7f4#.ub69zflcv">recent blog post about system blindness</a>
and it reminded me how critical this need is. Our
systems get more and more numerous and small. The reliability and debugging of
a platform now goes into various loops given the multiplication of actors.</p>

<p>Observability should be one core pre-requisite when designing a service
oriented architecture with micro-services. But just having everything plugged
to some ELK is not going to help that much. I feel that there is a new job in
there. Some function that has to be fulfilled. Something to reduce that vast
amount of data into something that makes sense. An intermediary that will
correlate logs from various sources. It would put them together and reduce
them to some meaningful &lsquo;events&rsquo;.</p>

<p>So I think observability is not enough. Digestibility is what makes
observability worth it. Maybe such tools already exist? Hmm, probably in the
containers worlds there is something like that. Is there not?</p>

              <p>If you only ever have lived in only one country, you really should consider
fixing it. Going <a href="https://inassets1-internationsgmbh.netdna-ssl.com/static/bundles/internationsexpatinsider/pdf/expat_insider_2016_the_internations_survey.pdf">live in another country</a> for some years or more is just
such a way towards a richer life. It&rsquo;s usually easy to recognize people that
are multi-rooted, as they often have an increased depth in their personal
philosophy.</p>

<p>We are lucky, in our craft, to have various opportunities to travel and work
remotely, or for foreign companies. Many of you are already aware of those
benefits. But to the others I can just say this: use this opportunity! Get
out!</p>

            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>Earlier this week I read <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-work-from-home-oleg-vishnepolsky">an article on linkedin, deliberately anti-remote</a>,
and a bit later on <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-economics-of-working-remotely-28d4173e16e2#.43ewevr3t">another one very pro-remote on freecodecamp</a>.
I&rsquo;m tempted to think one is the response to the other. But maybe not.</p>

<p>The fact is that switching to a remote organization is a tricky move. It feels
like the move from monolith to micro-services, honestly. People that make
decisions about it rarely envision the extent of the change. And those change
look similar in nature. Team architecture and software design are not that
foreign. More autonomy for services or people, self-contained activity,
requirement for clear communication channels and protocols, extensive
architecture for monitoring, reporting or just plain visibility, more
debugging tools and processes, and much more.</p>

<p>The same way one will have to think about all those when switching to
microservices, the one that thinks about making his team remote will also have
to consider the exact same parameters. But that is all on the principles.
About the implementation, remote teams really need a strong chat culture, an
easy and transparent logging policy for all communication channels, various
tooling similar to chatops tools for assisting communication activity. Remote
organization also need to have all their processes online, and not need much
(if at all) any synchronous meetings.</p>

<p>From my perspective there are various very beneficial side-effects to make a
team remote. There is more traceability as everything is online and not in
corridors anymore. In some cases that I experienced, it also leads to a less
arbitrary perception on team members, because they can be judged more on
results (if you have measure tools prepared accordingly) than on attitude and
mouth-skills (did you noticed that irl meetings are sometimes just a
mouth-o-cracy?). But it&rsquo;s accurate to say that on a short term, it is more
time consuming. The real benefit rises on the long run.</p>

<p>What I didn&rsquo;t find in any articles on the matter, is the life-cycle dimension.
A software project has a life expectancy, from a business point of view. It&rsquo;s
the same game as with the technical debt. It is acceptable business-wise to
live at credit for a time, until a certain milestone. A lot of projects are
just extended MVPs intended to convince big money that they could deserve some
attention. For such project, you want very fast paced environment. It&rsquo;s easier
to coerce your <s>slaves</s> employees to go above and beyond the
expectations, when in a physical environment. This is a disposable context,
and you can skip team debt as much as technical debt. And you really need
physicality for that purpose.</p>

<p>So, I would say, if a company is not making the move towards remote
organization, maybe there are very good reasons for that. But I will be very
cautious to understand what are the real reasons. They may stink. And if they
are remote, but they just came to it recently, I would be careful about the
tooling they prepared for it.</p>

            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>During the past year I have been doing some working out. No no there is no
fitbit involved. Are you crazy? My physical activity includes a strict refusal
of pointless efforts. I deliberately choose to use the bike rather than the
bus, it has the purpose of transportation,. But just getting sweaty for the
sake of it, well, that&rsquo;s not my thing. I&rsquo;m talking about a git-commit working
out. I decided to have one commit a day on github (minimum) and instead of the
fitbit or whatever phone app, I used the github timeline as a monitor.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s one year now and I got my <a href="https://github.com/mose/">github
timeline</a> all green. In itself it doesn&rsquo;t achieve
anything except for myself. I mean, it&rsquo;s quite easy to fill up a timeline with
fake entries. But by getting this challenge of one commit a day, it led to
some valuable outcomes. I got some more work projects validated to be
published as open source. Whenever I was not feeling inspired for code commit,
I was chasing typoes in my Readme&rsquo;s, or dependencies upgrades in my gems.</p>

<p>Overall, it had quite a good impact on my coding publication, on the updating
of my blog (well, that blpg mostly gather the rants I do here), and various
other small details. Well, I&rsquo;m not a very famous open source coder, just an
average joe. But a persistent one. It&rsquo;s very easy to just upload shit on
github and forget about it. Having this regular commitment made me come back
on some old things, keep them current somehow.</p>

<p>Getting some routine in place that includes open source activity has various
benefits, even when you don&rsquo;t have an audience. You should try it.</p>

              <p>Yesterday morning, the hunt for Pokemons opened here in Taiwan. I have been
watching the crazy adoption of this new trend in the past few weeks. And
knowing the asian culture, I suspect Japan and Taiwan are going to make the
craziness in the rest of the world just like mild interest.</p>

<p>There are few occasions to notice a huge shift in civilization as clearly as
this one. For sure we have noticed that our fellow human neighbors spend more
and more time the nose on their mobile devices. But this pokemon enthusiasm
bring it to a whole new level. It proves the virtual now begins to overrule
the real in term of social conventions. Well, not for everybody, not
everywhere, but in a proportion that is relevant enough to be noticeable.</p>

<p>The real world always have been ruling the social activities. Laws and
conventions were deciding who is in and who is out, what to do and how to do
it right. This is going to change. My main concern is that the future of the
social activity is in the hands of private companies. Those companies,
legitimately driven by profit, consider the user as a resource, that requires
gathering and retention strategies. Like herds. The whole privacy fight is not
going to stand too long as cattle (oops I meant user) data is the 21st century
gold, and economy (and crazy need for constant growth) depends on it.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m not really happy from this deduction. We are getting captured with
advanced weapons generated by behavioral economics and other clever social
sciences. They are manipulation tools. Just tools. Sure you can do good with
them, but such powerful tools of mass manipulation are not going to stay
neutral in the hands of those who want to squeeze our essence (feels like a
matrix metaphor, yeah I&rsquo;m aware of it).</p>

<p>Our mobile devices become interfaces now. Direct access to our behaviors. They
already have been great tracking and data collection devices for years. Now
they begin to be manipulative with much more effectiveness. Sure, the pokemon
hunting doesn&rsquo;t seem to harm much, but I see it as only a beginning, a
trigger. It just makes sense. Everybody can see the success it has. Certainly
there are already hundreds of projects that are seeing the light right now at
this instant just under the visibility of that opportunity. And many of those
will be clever, engaging, and impacting on the real world, by the way of
mobile devices, the reverse-remote-control for getting a grip on every human
being.</p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;m an old guy, I&rsquo;m of course very worried about this future. I have
memories of a past where it was so much different. But the young generations,
seeing this as the norm, will just fall for it, without question. Don&rsquo;t get me
wrong, I love good tools that can make our lives easier. But they are tools.
The intent of their usage matters. Augmented reality just seems to be going to
be used with very nefarious intents.</p>

<p>hrum. Well yeah, this is a rant, that&rsquo;s nothing more. Not an essay, not a
study. Just my guts getting spread over the table. Take it easy :)</p>

              <p>Since I slowly becomes the chatops specialist where I work, I get to think I
want more. Since the beginning we have been interacting with programs
essentially with graphical interfaces. First asynchronous if we think about
the web, now more and more synchronous, but they are interfaces that are not
human. They are designed for giving control to the operators of those
interfaces.</p>

<p>But the more we advance in autonomy of our programs, the more we should trust
them to sort the information by priorities. The interfaces like Siri, Echo,
are much more &lsquo;human&rsquo; and conversational. It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to
speculate that interfaces are going to die one day, except for very
specialized usages, and more interaction will be just more conversational.</p>

<p>In the course of my development of interactive agents for technical needs, I
noticed that adding just a little bit of intelligence and memory in those
agents goes a long way in usability. Especially in chatops, a lot of the
actions required from those agents are predicable and repetitive. The
development of new features should follow the recognition of those patterns
and shorten the path to accomplish some actions. That&rsquo;s pretty much my job.</p>

<p>But coding this continually is not very cost effective. Tools also change,
then patterns evolve. Now all I can think about is a way to design an irc bot
that learns by itself. Some program that does real meta-programming and
considers its commands as data rather than hard-coded pre-conceived path for
the information to flow.</p>

<p>If you know some tools that already do that, can you fire me a mail?</p>

            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>Last week I got to check out 2 javascript frontend frameworks, <a href="https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo">Choo</a>
(the cute framwework) and <a href="http://cycle.js.org/">Cycle.js</a> (the streams power). It feels
that nowadays React is eating the frontend world, but there is actually a lot
of non-marginal alternatives. It made me think that there is something tricky
with the process of innovation. It is born from disagreement. It feeds with
discontent.</p>

<p>Those frameworks are born from the refusal to consider React as a consensus,
hence it generates an alternative path, exploring different paradigms. In my
opinion, and from an global point of view, it&rsquo;s a sign of vivacity of an
ecosystem. Diversity of species guarantees a larger span of choice for the
natural selection and a faster evolution.</p>

<p>But consensus and normative approaches have so many virtues. Damn, this is
tricky. Well, here is the catch. Unicity in the software ecosystem creates
stability, which in turn creates comfort for the actors involved in the
industry. Habits get stronger, mobility is easier, interoperability leads to
bigger systems with long life-cycles. This is good.</p>

<p>On another hand diversity creates instability, challenges the developers and
makes it harder to find common grounds. It favors exploration and smaller
systems with shorter life-cycles. In a diverse ecosystem, paradigms and new
ideas are born and die quickly. And I think it&rsquo;s a much more rich ecosystem.</p>

<p>For some reason this duality reminds me of the cathedral and the bazaar. It&rsquo;s
totally unrelated, actually, but maybe there is some kind of interesting
parallel in this metaphor collision. But beyond that, there is a real
antagonism for developers, and an opposing interest between the development
workforce and the software as a living species.</p>

<p>And I have the feeling that on the long run, diversity and innovation win. So
you better get used to the discomfort it brings. Train yourself to jump from
one framework to another. Don&rsquo;t let yourself getting lazy by going to the
comfortable consensus systematically. This ability to cope with change is your
best hope for staying current. Because the change if the way of the evolution.</p>
