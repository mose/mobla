            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>For years I noticed the difficulty to extract decent information from
developers and craftsmen about their work. Developers clearly lack the
skill or the taste for documentation. It extends to the specifications,
which also provides an occasion to notice bad performance.</p>

<p>To work this around, specialized project managers have to fill this role,
but it can create a gap between developers ownership and the final result.
Sometimes luck creates the inspiration and developers produce a decent
amount of documentation. But honestly, this is pure luck, and not a rule.</p>

<p>I found a way to mitigate this issue, that I began to experiment some time
ago at work. It&rsquo;s based on a recorded interaction between a project person and
a person of the craft.</p>

<p>Here are the rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>the project person organizes interviews with stakeholders from all specialties
including developers, business people, operations people, sometimes users,
the more diverse population possible. But it can also be done for no reason
for sharing a certain kind of knowledge with an expert.</li>
<li>interviews take place by written interactive communication in a chat,
in a way that enables logging (irc, slack, whatever)</li>
<li>it lasts 20 minutes more or less, but the format can extend to hours if the need is felt</li>
<li>once the interview is finished, the interviewer cleans up the logs, removes out of topic
details, fixes typoes, removes elements that are purely belonging to the chat way of communication</li>
<li>the cleaned log is reviewed by the interviewee for consensual agreement on its publication</li>
<li>the log can then be added to whatever project space is dedicated to the topic at hand
(documentation, specification annexes, study, paper)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are various beneficial side effects to this endeavor:</p>

<ul>
<li>actors have a better feeling of engagement in the project or topic at hand</li>
<li>it creates a bond between actors, facilitates future exchanges</li>
<li>it gives an equal chance for everyone to speak, even the shy ones, because the 1 to 1
context is much less frightening. In a meeting, there are people that never speak.
Are they stupid? they are not!</li>
<li>it creates content that can be shared with other actors so that they have a better
chance to understand the point of views of other parties.</li>
<li>it creates a useful reference for the project, a raw material which can be annexed
and can be used for summaries. It also creates more content for an eventual search engine
if the publication space has one.</li>
<li>there is less risk to cite someone out of context because the full context is provided.</li>
<li>it is much easier to organize interviews or hold them on the fly than setup meetings.</li>
<li>there is no feeling of loss of time like in a meeting: the time dedicated is intense
and very interactive, there is no waste.</li>
</ul>

<p>I had the occasion to try that technique in a context where internal communication is
not optimal, for knowledge sharing at first, then for exploring options on a new project
and set up specifications. I have been happy to notice that this formula creates pretty
good output and generates a nice feeling in all parties involved.</p>

<p>Certainly more study will come on this approach. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>

            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>This is a word I love. I found it again in a <a href="https://medium.com/production-ready/systems-blindness-and-how-we-deal-with-it-d601fa63b7f4#.ub69zflcv">recent blog post about system blindness</a>
and it reminded me how critical this need is. Our
systems get more and more numerous and small. The reliability and debugging of
a platform now goes into various loops given the multiplication of actors.</p>

<p>Observability should be one core pre-requisite when designing a service
oriented architecture with micro-services. But just having everything plugged
to some ELK is not going to help that much. I feel that there is a new job in
there. Some function that has to be fulfilled. Something to reduce that vast
amount of data into something that makes sense. An intermediary that will
correlate logs from various sources. It would put them together and reduce
them to some meaningful &lsquo;events&rsquo;.</p>

<p>So I think observability is not enough. Digestibility is what makes
observability worth it. Maybe such tools already exist? Hmm, probably in the
containers worlds there is something like that. Is there not?</p>

            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>Few weeks ago I began to prepare a copy of the Green Ruby Template system for
the usage of the Remote Meetup team. It&rsquo;s kind of ironic because, from some
point of view, this code is a sin and was not written in the perspective to be
generic. It&rsquo;s deliberately not constrained to code best practices, it&rsquo;s
joyfully messy and blatantly suboptimal. It was a quick and dirty scripting
solution, it could have been a set of shell scripts, well it happens to be
using ruby. <a href="https://github.com/greenruby/grn-static/blob/master/lib/builder.rb">Check it out</a> if you don&rsquo;t believe me.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s doing the job for years now. It&rsquo;s a builder code, so it&rsquo;s run as a
convenience only a few times a week, it doesn&rsquo;t really need to be fast. It
just needs to do the job. Trust me I like good code, with clean design and
full test coverage. But this one was just an intimate assistant of mine which
was not really a software. Just some automation scripts.</p>

<p>And now here it is, I get to face a situation where some friends need the same
setup and I can&rsquo;t just give them the code, it&rsquo;s so custom. But there have been
only a few changes to make and it was ready. But the interesting part is in
the process. While duplicating the code for the Remote Meetup newsletter,
well, I extracted some stuff, made a config file to remove various hardcoded
things.</p>

<p>Well it is still a big ball of dirty code, but in the duplication, it got more
generic. I love that feeling which brings the software development world
closer from the biological world. There is some kind of evolutionary process
going on in the life of a software. It takes many forms and I like it when I
get reminded of those similarities. I could go on and on about the topics that
an open source ecosystem is necessary for the diversity of code to flourish
and make evolution possible in a totally Darwinian way.</p>

<p>So this simple operation was just illustrating one principle: when you share
your code you shape it and make it more generic in the process. It can have
various beneficial side effects beyond the single act of duplication and
adaptation. I find it&rsquo;s also true when you publish your code as an open source
project. If it gets some traction and people start to use it, they will import
their context in your initial ecosystem and bring the same kind of
adjustments. Making it stronger, in some way.</p>

<p>Anyways, the <a href="http://remotemeetup.com/news/index.html">Remote Meetup News</a> website and newsletter generator is now
ready, and you may find that the design is kind of familiar. Well, the rule of
the path of least resistance also apply here for sure. I begin to apply back
on Green Ruby the changes I made over there. I suspect the third duplication,
of any, will be the extraction of the common parts in a separate codebase,
like a gem with a lib.</p>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>That link to <a href="http://shoutcloud.io">Shoutcloud</a> made me laugh and then made me think.
It&rsquo;s not the first time I see some micro-service publicly available. 2 years
ago there was some talk about <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/05/nano-services">nano-services as an antipattern</a>.
But when you push the logic a little further, and at a very large scale, maybe
it&rsquo;s a projection of what the future will be.</p>

<p>Imagine our software totally destructured, calling functions taht are stored
on the net, using some load balanced worldwide environment. We already do that
with CDNs. Javascript next Modules proposals will go in that direction as
well. But what is a method call in a program that we know today could become a
service call of an external globally available function.</p>

<p>After all we always write the same code. How many time did you write a regexp
for <a href="http://emailregex.com/">email pattern validation</a>? The RFC 822 and 5322 are nasties,
yeah. If we had no latency consideration, I would gladly delegate various
pieces of code to a specialized service. But latency, is it really an issue
now? We work more and more with async code, with queues and messages. What
seems heretic for our current legacy standards would not seem that foolish in
a slightly different context.</p>

<p>So technically, I suppose nanoservices are a possible future. I even think
it&rsquo;s a requirement for scaling any kind of agent-based architecture. Machine
learning will be much better off by just registering maps to knowledge than
knowledge itself. But I wonder about the economical side of things. The old
capitalist market economy is already stretching its reach far beyond its
original statement with immaterial economy. The totally destructured
immaterial one will certainly propose an interesting challenge.</p>

            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>This aspect of development, called Documentation, is the source of various
frustrations. It&rsquo;s hard to get do it, but why? My feeling is that it&rsquo;s like
testing. When you begin your craft as a coder, all what matters is the code.
It&rsquo;s only after some iterations that some non-code aspects come back bite you
in the neck. Like, huho, now that I need to refactor, I really should use
something that tells me if all still works. Tests become an early necessity to
anyone who knows that kind of truth. If you wait until the end of a coding
cycle to write those, the task is huge and it cuts you from your productivity
cycle. Write them early, along the flow, is way easier.</p>

<p>So I think documentation follows the same pattern. So many software projects
are badly documented because this aspect is postponed until it&rsquo;s needed. Means
at release stage. In early stages, you work on a prototype and you don&rsquo;t need
to explain how things work or are supposed to work. And when it&rsquo;s released,
there is usually some other task waiting and it&rsquo;s hard to stop everything to
get back and document things properly. It may be a flaw in the agile process,
but it may also be a feature: if you don&rsquo;t document along the way, you won&rsquo;t
document much.</p>

<p>Personally I try to consider the documentation of any of the source code I
write as one of the first tasks. There are various tricks that can help in
that perspective, like <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html">readme-driven development</a>, or including the doc
inside the code with <a href="http://yardoc.org/">yarddoc</a> or <a href="http://ilyabylich.svbtle.com/apipie-amazing-tool-for-documenting-your-rails-api">apipie</a>, or coupling
documentation with tests with <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/zipmark/rspec-api-documentation/docs/generate-html-documentation-from-test-examples">rspec</a> or <a href="https://github.com/zipmark/rspec_api_documentation">RSpec API Doc
Generator</a>. But honestly I prefer edited documentation that can follow
a structure that is thought as documentation rather than merely an automated
output of some code.</p>

<p>There are various tools to organize edited documentation, like
<a href="https://readthedocs.org/">ReadTheDoc</a> which is in python. Another project appeared last week from
the guys at Pluralsight named <a href="http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/faq/">hack.guide()</a>. That&rsquo;s a community project
but actually being totally open sourced, I was thinking the <a href="https://github.com/pluralsight/guides-cms">documentation
building CMS</a> they made could pretty much fill the gap of a
light-weight RTD, with the benefits of having a UI for editors. Too bad we
don&rsquo;t have anything like this in ruby (or do we?).</p>

            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>Recently Marcelo told me, that&rsquo;s weird, how we do 10% research and
specification, 40% implementation and 50% debugging in this industry. I&rsquo;m more
used to 70% research and specification, 20% implementation and 10% debugging.
He was working in the hardhware industry for a while, and just came to a
service-based company. This is actually a very interesting remark and it
reminded me when I was in my twenties when I was working as a construction
worker.</p>

<p>When I was young there was no internet and I had a 10 years break from
computers. I had to take stupid jobs like working on construction sites for
low wages. After that I went to art school and later on I worked on building
sets for business shows. I have been shocked by the gap between those 2
worlds. When building a house, there is so much time spent writing plans,
thinking things in advance. While in the show-business construction pattern,
it was mostly about improvisation and managing inflexible time constraints,
with one-time-use construction.</p>

<p>I feel there is the same gap in the software industry. Well it&rsquo;s not exactly
the same for sure, but the paradigm feels alike. In service software
production, SaaS or ISP businesses, we tend to under-engineer the production.
There are perfectly legitimate reasons for that, the life-cycle of a platform
of service is quick, volatile and the value is not in the software asset but
in the customer-user experience.</p>

<p>The Agile organization model reinforces this pattern, by providing a
substitute to the early specifications, in the form of user experiences
description. All this is fine and good. For a time. But with years passing we
can see so many occurrences of &lsquo;temporary&rsquo; projects becoming indestructible
legacy monsters. It&rsquo;s like there was some kind of tipping point where the
development should shift from under-engineered to well-engineered but it&rsquo;s
rarely anticipated properly enough.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s pretty hard to address that kind of problem. Throwing away the early
instances is very costly, especially when the organization is shaped by a
fast-paced reactive production model. Introducing proper engineering at early
stages is also not a clever option, as the product has to adapt to the
service, which depends on a constant feedback loop with the users.</p>

<p>I have the feeling that there is something missing. Like an evolution of agile
that could include seeds of later engineering. Some way to make possible to
start fast, and evolve in a solid and slower model later on without crisis or
disruption. This is the perspective that I think was missing in <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-computer-programmers-need-to-stop-calling-themselves-engineers-already-2015-11">that
article</a> I cited on green ruby 145. But I don&rsquo;t know the answer to
that problem. I suspect it will emerge by itself in the few next years.</p>

              <p>For a while now, and more even since the rise of docker, it becomes a trend to
split applications in parts and approach them as a collection of
micro-services. This is not exactly new, I remember in 2002 having seen
various applications based on this concept. But they had shortcomings.
Development was harder and it imported a whole bunch of increased complexity
because there was a lot of moving parts.</p>

<p>In a project that I have the occasion of following, I can watch the migration
from monolith to micro-service and I can tell you, the architecture change is
not simple technical decision. By splitting application there is a whole lot
of application aspects that move out of the area of the developers team and
are now the responsibility of the infrastructure team. The shift cannot be
taken lightly.</p>

<p>From what I observed, the switch to micro-services can only be efficient if
there was already a shift to a real devops organization. It means that the
development and the infrastructure are more tightly coupled. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s
just a mess. The QA also can get crazy, and the networking layer gets
increased complexity (or even dramatic latencies). Errors and services
resilience also need an extra layer of attention.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t move to micro-services if you are not ready for it, seriously, it can
end up by shooting yourself in the foot.</p>

            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>Today while wandering around in my weekly hunt for good links, my eye has been
attracted by a post named <a href="https://medium.com/@scosta/coding-is-three-dimensional-cb331d1b4ad8">Coding is three dimensional</a>. It&rsquo;s quite an
interesting way to consider it. But the reason why it struck me is that it was
missing the fourth dimension. That makes all the difference when you get years
of coding. You know that time is a parameter.</p>

<p>Code don&rsquo;t exist out of time. It has a past, perspective of a future, that
both shape its current morphology. There are a lot of efforts to produce code
analysis. But the real analyst is an historian and needs a systemic approach
that includes time as a factor. We are still far from being able to automate
that. In some ways, it&rsquo;s a good news, we won&rsquo;t be replaced by small scripts
very soon.</p>

<p>The time factor is actually the essential element in the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html">technical debt</a>
formula. Purist coders can&rsquo;t cope with technical debt but if you have two
onces of business man inside, it makes total sense. The tradeoff in technical
quality versus fast deliverability only makes sense because the timing is
critical. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/a-mess-is-not-a-technical-debt">A mess is not a technical debt</a>.</p>

<p>If coding was disconnected from the market, and if it was not a business or
more like an art, maybe time would not be that critical. But even open source
software is dependent on the market at one point or another. I fail to see how
it could be different.</p>

<p>Honestly, I would prefer clean coding and no market tradeoff, but that&rsquo;s just
a dream.</p>

            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been playing with Hubot plugins code in coffeescript for our
company. That&rsquo;s a while I didn&rsquo;t do much js but I used it for a long time and
I didn&rsquo;t find it too difficult to catch up. But for some reason, it brought me
the same feeling I have each time I get back to that language. I feel dirty.
Still I can do what I need to do, for sure, but I don&rsquo;t feel like a builder,
more like an acrobat. And I&rsquo;m far from a purist.</p>

<p>Some people talk about javascript taking over the world. But that language
imho just was there at the right place at the right time. By having a runtime
embedded in browsers and browsers libraries, it has been used to hijack the
most used software on our computers and mobile devices, to transform them into
richer clients. Along the way various layers were added to fulfill the need of
software design, because javascript initial goal was merely DOM manipulation.</p>

<p>The thing that always stroke me the most with javascript is that despite the
efforts from ecmascript, it has no formal standard or documentation. It is
pretty extensively documented, of course, but because the language is pushed
forward by the implementations rather than from a standard body, it gets a bit
messy.</p>

<p>I saw a <a href="http://cube-drone.com/comics/c/relentless-persistence">drawing</a> this week that illustrates the mess quite well. It feels
like Javascript is waiting for something to come replace it.</p>

<p>But there is hope with ES6. Seems like in recent years the normative effort on
the ecmascript standard got some more traction and some more press coverage.
But I personally don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to bring the solution. I enjoyed
reading the <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/future-programming-webassembly-life-after-javascript/">thoughts of Eric Elliot</a> on that topic but I&rsquo;m not sure
he&rsquo;s right on everything. But what he&rsquo;s right about, is that there will be an
after-javascript.</p>

<p>Unless that after javascript doesn&rsquo;t arrive fast enough and gets useless by
some new programming paradigm that may appear one day soon. I mean, in the
next 10 years. At some point, like big data is too complex to be handled by
human, programming will also get too complex and will be handled by
algorithms. We already <a href="http://phys.org/news/2015-07-code-faster-expert.html">see it coming</a>. And all programmers will then
become high end workflow designers or just play with antiquities.</p>

<p>In this perspective, I think javascript is a great intermediary technology for
the time being, given its pervasive aspect. It&rsquo;s far from satisfying, but it
does the job. But the younger generation should keep an eye on higher level
abstract approaches, like systems architectures, workflow logics, organization
patterns, because imho that will drive software design in the next 10-20
years.</p>

              <a href="http://blog.mose.com/2015/06/21/the-yin-and-yang-of-software-development/" class="post-title">The yin and yang of software development</a>
            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>The topic I talked about last week led me to think about it more widely. And I
ended up with the thinking that many problems in software companies are a
clear problem of balance between their yin and their yang.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang">old chinese principle</a> is documented in a very old-fashioned
way, opposing genders and principles. But actually it sums up in the fact that
many dynamics are to be based in a balance between two opposing principles.
Otherwise they fail.</p>

<p>The way I see it, software developers are a nurturing kind. This profile has
to consider long term. It decides actions for later outcomes. It&rsquo;s about
giving life and growing it. It feels closer to the Yin principle.</p>

<p>On another hand, the business people are bound to a shorter time frame. And I
don&rsquo;t talk about the entrepreneurs and the rare visionary people, but the real
business work force. They are competitive, aggressive, fighters. That really
feels to me like the Yang concept.</p>

<p>And all occurrences where I saw software companies failing, I think it was
because there was a lack of balance between those 2 principles. Either the
management was too soft and not aggressive enough towards its market, either
it was too aggressive and nurturing was not considered enough in their
equation.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that this balance requirement applies to everything, to be
honest. But in a constituted body of a software organization, considering the
current (questionable) market economy, it feels that the Yin and the Yang have
to be in balance to grant a chance of survival to the organization.</p>

<p>One may have the feeling that the dominant Yang (business side) is the more
common case. But they are just more noisy. Many projects stay silently in the
darkness just because there was no real business consideration (or even
refusal of it).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://modeling-languages.com/grady-booch-on-the-future-of-software-engineering-video-and-highlights/">keynote of Grady Booch</a> (linked in the video section) confirmed
me in various ways in this opinion. Engineers have the duty to fight for the
balance when they can. They have to understand that it&rsquo;s not a one-way deal,
as well. If you want to exercise programming in a nurturing-only context, win
a lottery and dedicate your time writing free software (where market
requirements don&rsquo;t apply). But in the usual case, you may have to consider if
you are in a balanced context, and if not, try to work on balancing it.</p>
