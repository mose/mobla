## Happy end of 2015

Take good time, use the calendar rotation as a pretext to have good
resolutions, get wasted like if you were a teenager (wait, what? we all are
teenagers here?), or do whatever makes you happy if like me you prefer to
remain sober. See you in 2016.

## SlackCast 2016

We had a lot of discussion with Nauman Tariq about how to make slack usage
more lively, more useful, and such things. We worked together on a concept of
event that we want to try next weekend. It will happen next Saturday (Jan 2nd)
around 23:00 UTC (more or less 4 hours). If you want to participate, please
shoot me an [email][mail], and we'll give you the precise time when we know
it, plus the how-to-join-in. It will be a first time, it won't be perfect, but
it will be a lot of fun.

Read more about it on the [SlackCast manifesto][manifesto]. You also can join
[rubyonrails.link][link], that's where it will happen.
