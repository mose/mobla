            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>Because I had some time recently I watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ciconf2014">whole batch of videos</a> of the
&ldquo;Collective Intelligence Conference&rdquo; from 2014 on youtube.
It&rsquo;s part of my exploration of that field, see what changed in the past years.</p>

<p>Well, those were pretty interesting talks but it stroke me that there was a clear ambiguity of terms there.
It&rsquo;s related to the english usage of the &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; word. The exact same word in french only means the
capacity to process information and take decisions. This is a human trait, somehow a way to distinguish
us from the rest of the animal realm.</p>

<p>But in english it also is used by government as &ldquo;data collection&rdquo;, as in &ldquo;business intelligence&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;the intelligence community&rdquo;. In french, we call that &ldquo;renseignement&rdquo;, so it&rsquo;s a totally separate concept.
So, from my french perspective, I didn&rsquo;t anticipate the impact of this double meaning for the word &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo;
while watching talks about &ldquo;Collective Intelligence&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So there was a lot of talks about crowdsourcing, about new ways to gather information from previously
untaped sources by the way of massive internet participation. And not that much about the other intelligence
which is about organizing data and structural design of human interaction.</p>

<p>They held conferences in <a href="http://www.ci2012.org/">2012</a> but the <a href="http://cci.mit.edu/ci2012/plenaries/index.html">links to videos</a> failed, in [2014][ci214],
which is the one I found videos for, in <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/collectiveintelligence/">2015</a> found no videos, in <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/stern.nyu.edu/collective-intelligence-conference/home">2016</a> videos are in <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/stern.nyu.edu/collective-intelligence-conference/plenary-sessions">google drive</a>.
The <a href="http://collectiveintelligenceconference.org/">2017 edition</a> is just happening right now and I hope there will be videos.</p>

<p>There are a lot of academic papers linked to those talks. Pretty good content.</p>

<p>But what I&rsquo;m interested in seems to be a very small subset of what is called Collective Intelligence nowadays.
I may need to define the term more explicitly. Let&rsquo;s call it Intentional Collective Intelligence Engineering.
Because as a software developer and a systems architect, I&rsquo;m interested in building things, designing its cogs,
anticipating its impact on usage and on norms.</p>

<p>While I like collecting feedback from the users of my solutions, I also know that the numerous choices you do
when designing a system impact on the usages in very deep ways. Ways that the user cannot anticipate or imagine.
Those are not always conscious habits that are influenced. There are always natural (or systemic) forces that
drive a group to adopt specific strategies after having analyzed and matured the knowledge of its context.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m pretty convinced that the Collective Intelligence I seek can be engineered. A proper environment,
set of conventions, incentives and obstacles, can be deliberately designed for the purpose of emergence
of that collective intelligence in a group of participants.</p>

<p>I have seen glimpses of it happen while participating in open source community development. I know there are bricks
already existing to create various conditions necessary to the emergence. It&rsquo;s not an utopia.</p>

            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>Today I&rsquo;m closing <a href="http://greenruby.org">Green Ruby</a>. That newsletter, started on february 2013,
has been a self-imposed weekly duty for more than 4 years. I take a lot
of pride not to have missed one single week during those 225 weeks.</p>

<p>But now that we decided, my friends and I, to put it to an end, there is an
interesting question popping up. What will happen with the list of 2,000 subscribers?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s common knowledge that nowadays, when you don&rsquo;t pay for a service, you are the product.
But honestly, I hate this statement, however relevant it may be.
It eludes any possibility of generosity, and any chance to enjoy a gift economy.
Open source software is an example of this.
You don&rsquo;t pay for it, but by using it, you are not used as an asset or a resource.</p>

<p>So as a symbolic gesture of rebellion, I decided that, by ending the publication,
I will delete the list of subscribers. Forever.</p>

<p>I always felt raped when I subscribe to a service under a certain context, and then
the service provider gets acquired by another company and my account gets automatically
transferred. The contract changes, I have agreed to the initial setup, but why presume
I would automatically agree to any other context? This is the real annoyance in
that user-as-a-product thing. You are not considered as a thinking being anymore.</p>

<p>I hate this!</p>

<p>So the deletion of that list of email is a symbolic sacrifice. Why did you invest all
that time and effort during those 4 years then, will you ask me? Well, I was willing
to contribute to a common interest, out of generosity and love for my peers and friends.
Why should I need a money-related reason? Money kills the social link, it neutralize
the unmeasurable debt that we establish between each others as a community.</p>

<p>A society without generosity, is a society of isolated people. Gifts creates a feeling of debt,
that debt is a bond. If the gift is not personal, it relates you to a community.
Never forget about it. Pay it forward.</p>

            <div class="post-description">
              

<p>A collection of events occurred since my last post. I was really hoping to
get some deep dive into writing more about collective intelligence, in the background.
But various things came and distracted me from that initial trajectory.</p>

<h2 id="hubot-revival:195c338923f21c367264a5b5fb00e8a9">Hubot revival</h2>

<p>First, there has been a revival of the <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot">Hubot project</a>. I wrote a bunch of
plugins for that chatbot for internal usage at Gandi in the past year. I have been poking
around in the community complaining that it became some sort of abandonware. Issues on github
were not addressed, PR unanswered, irc was silent.</p>

<p>Then one day 3 weeks ago, <a href="https://github.com/bkeepers">bkeepers</a> came up and <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/ROADMAP.md">woke it up</a>.
It appears that now Github has plan for this codebase. They want to include it in its products
more officially, says the rumor (nothing official yet). But it makes a lot of sense.
So then he gathered people that could be involved in the revival of the project. I was
contacted to join the core team. That&rsquo;s what you get by nagging people.</p>

<p>Since then it has been quite great to clean up backlog, re-examine old ideas, help setup
new process and tooling for community gardening. I never get tired to see how informal
communities can shape up and self-organize.</p>

<h2 id="quiting-is-not-a-bad-thing:195c338923f21c367264a5b5fb00e8a9">Quiting is not a bad thing</h2>

<p>Around the same time, I felt inspired by handing my resignation of my current job at Gandi.
There is nothing wrong with the job, and most reasonable people could argue that I&rsquo;m just stupid.
But there are a combination of factors that led me to think I was not using my potential at
full capacity.</p>

<p>Working on a large infrastructure as a sysadmin was great, but it&rsquo;s pretty hard to build new things
properly in the service industry. It&rsquo;s always about contingency management, and reacting to the environment.
It&rsquo;s more about doing the fireman than the gardener. Well, honestly, I think it&rsquo;s a question of intent
and culture and that could have been addressed. But I didn&rsquo;t see any hint that could let me think this
environment would become intentional about gardening anytime soon.</p>

<p>So, out of the blue, I left. I chose a moment where there was no crisis, no trouble, no real reason
to quit except a strong feeling that it was time to move on. That way, transition is painless, there
is no frustration involved. I hate conflicts. My advice: never wait the burn out to make your move out.</p>

<h2 id="green-ruby-end-of-life:195c338923f21c367264a5b5fb00e8a9">Green ruby end of life</h2>

<p>In the mood of transitionning, this week I proposed that we close the <a href="http://greenruby.org">Green Ruby</a> adventure.
For some months Xenor has taken over the publication process. But he&rsquo;s himself bunt out a bit.
So after 4 years of publication, it&rsquo;s time to close this properly and move on.</p>

<p>That weekly links collection was a fun exercise. And I&rsquo;m really happy to have refused any business
side track on this operation, it would have been much harder to close.</p>

<h2 id="what-next:195c338923f21c367264a5b5fb00e8a9">What next?</h2>

<p>I decided that I could stay funemployed for a while (that&rsquo;s the proper term, right?). I&rsquo;m planning
to look around, play with techs, talk with friends, hold on any decision to engage in anything.
It&rsquo;s time to re-assess my roadmap. This is what is great in transitions.
By losing contact with the ground, you can feel the direction of the wind.</p>

<p>Maybe I will get back to entrepreneurship, and setup some business venture. Maybe I will freelance for a while.
Maybe I will find a context in a company where I feel comfortable contributing. But honestly I have no clue.
And yet, this feels great.</p>

<h2 id="getting-back-to-old-friends:195c338923f21c367264a5b5fb00e8a9">Getting back to old friends</h2>

<p>In the first days after my decision to renounce my day job, I got back in contact with a lot of old friends.
Transitions have that side effect that you have to re-evaluate your environment, your network, your values.</p>

<p>Getting into a full-time job doesn&rsquo;t prevent that, of course, but you cannot give the same attention.
The center of gravity of an employed person is static. Now that I&rsquo;m floating, I have to dedicate much more
attention to my environment. And it&rsquo;s an excellent thing.</p>

<p>I will certainly have occasion to talk about my adventures very soon. Maybe I will force myself to write more.</p>

            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              

<p>I plan to share some thoughts about Collective Intelligence from a software perspective.
But this comes from an old story that I thought I should make public first.</p>

<h2 id="the-origins:ea7330696100fc7495594863651b3c82">The origins</h2>

<p>When I first began to program web applications, it was mostly for my own needs
as an activist (freedom of speech on internet, cryptography, and such matters).
Around 1998 I had a fully working solution called &lsquo;Collaborative writer&rsquo; or
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cwriter/">cWriter</a> for short, written in PHP. It was like a sort of wiki geared towards
small groups self-organization.</p>

<p>When I got to Claranet I deployed it as an internal solution, and worked on a
full company intranet called &lsquo;in&rsquo;. It was the occasion to release cWriter as
open source in 2000 on Sourceforge.</p>

<p>At that time it appeared obvious that my area of preference was about engineering
collaborative work. I was putting a lot of thoughts into that. I had this clear
understanding that the tool shapes the usages, especially in this new realm that
was internet communication.</p>

<p>Later on, I dedicated my time in various projects, mostly <a href="https://tiki.org/mose">Tikiwiki groupware</a> in 2003.
That experience was also rich in valuable experiments. I became leader in that community
because being unemployed at that time, I took the occasion to just invest time in
open source (being payed by labor insurance money). And I was just very prolific.
I established various bases for that community that still thrives today. I had a
<a href="https://tiki.org/Webinar+2012+10">recorded interview</a> with the guys for the 10 years for the project in 2012.</p>

<h2 id="the-discovery:ea7330696100fc7495594863651b3c82">The discovery</h2>

<p>Somewhere in 2004 I met with <a href="http://noubel.com/">JF Noubel</a>, that had some need for help on his own Tikiwiki
instance, called thetransitionner.org. His website (not available anymore nowadays)
was dedicated to promotion and exploration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence">Collective Intelligence</a>, following the work,
among others, of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_L%C3%A9vy">Pierre Lévy</a>.</p>

<p>I quickly identified this area of research as something that I was practicing and
aiming at, without having formally identified it. So I got more and more interested
into that field in the following years.</p>

<p>Jean-Francois became a friend, his approach evolved since then but I still got stuck with
his <a href="http://publishing.yudu.com/Library/Arswi/CollectiveIntelligen/resources/index.htm?skipFlashCheck=true">original presentation</a> describing the basics of Collective Intelligence.</p>

<p>Anyways it led me to some other kind of activism, revolving around some alternative currency
projects (like <a href="http://openmoney.org/">openmoney</a>), other projects concerning governance (like democracy 2.0,
from Mikael Nordfors cited in the <a href="https://archive.org/stream/eo_Collective_Intelligence/Collective_Intelligence_djvu.txt">transcript on archive.org</a>), and various other topics
that would be too long to list here.</p>

<p>Ultimately it led to get involved in <a href="http://angenius.org/tiki-index.php">Angenius</a> with <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanh_Nghiem">Than Nghiem</a> in a background of
sustainable development between 2006 and 2008. Including going to live in a farm in Normandy.
Which was amazing but I was just not made for it.</p>

<h2 id="the-migration:ea7330696100fc7495594863651b3c82">The migration</h2>

<p>In 2008 I decided to leave France and go live in Taiwan. I wanted to take a break and
learn Chinese. It was my decision for my 40th birthday. Since then I got various jobs in
development and then in system administration, grinding more programming languages and
technical skills. But I still kept all this time the background thinking on
collective intelligence.</p>

<p>What I wanted to experience was just another cultural background. I wanted to see patterns
a little better about open source communities and collaborative work in a different context.
Well. This could be the topic for another post. I got some surprises.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-next:ea7330696100fc7495594863651b3c82">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>

<p>Now, 9 years after, I feel it&rsquo;s more than time I get back to my past ventures. Well,
I didn&rsquo;t live like an hermit, I&rsquo;m involved in various local and global communities.
But I feel I could share a little more about what I learned in my past experiments.
Now that I reach my 50&rsquo;s, maybe I just feel like I have to begin writing stuff.</p>

<h2 id="interview-based-knowledge-sharing:1b8340b7f1acd4b3212e7dd40ccc3d0c">Interview-based knowledge sharing</h2>

<p>For years I noticed the difficulty to extract decent information from
developers and craftsmen about their work. Developers clearly lack the
skill or the taste for documentation. It extends to the specifications,
which also provides an occasion to notice bad performance.</p>

<p>To work this around, specialized project managers have to fill this role,
but it can create a gap between developers ownership and the final result.
Sometimes luck creates the inspiration and developers produce a decent
amount of documentation. But honestly, this is pure luck, and not a rule.</p>

<p>I found a way to mitigate this issue, that I began to experiment some time
ago at work. It&rsquo;s based on a recorded interaction between a project person and
a person of the craft.</p>

<p>Here are the rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>the project person organizes interviews with stakeholders from all specialties
including developers, business people, operations people, sometimes users,
the more diverse population possible. But it can also be done for no reason
for sharing a certain kind of knowledge with an expert.</li>
<li>interviews take place by written interactive communication in a chat,
in a way that enables logging (irc, slack, whatever)</li>
<li>it lasts 20 minutes more or less, but the format can extend to hours if the need is felt</li>
<li>once the interview is finished, the interviewer cleans up the logs, removes out of topic
details, fixes typoes, removes elements that are purely belonging to the chat way of communication</li>
<li>the cleaned log is reviewed by the interviewee for consensual agreement on its publication</li>
<li>the log can then be added to whatever project space is dedicated to the topic at hand
(documentation, specification annexes, study, paper)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are various beneficial side effects to this endeavor:</p>

<ul>
<li>actors have a better feeling of engagement in the project or topic at hand</li>
<li>it creates a bond between actors, facilitates future exchanges</li>
<li>it gives an equal chance for everyone to speak, even the shy ones, because the 1 to 1
context is much less frightening. In a meeting, there are people that never speak.
Are they stupid? they are not!</li>
<li>it creates content that can be shared with other actors so that they have a better
chance to understand the point of views of other parties.</li>
<li>it creates a useful reference for the project, a raw material which can be annexed
and can be used for summaries. It also creates more content for an eventual search engine
if the publication space has one.</li>
<li>there is less risk to cite someone out of context because the full context is provided.</li>
<li>it is much easier to organize interviews or hold them on the fly than setup meetings.</li>
<li>there is no feeling of loss of time like in a meeting: the time dedicated is intense
and very interactive, there is no waste.</li>
</ul>

<p>I had the occasion to try that technique in a context where internal communication is
not optimal, for knowledge sharing at first, then for exploring options on a new project
and set up specifications. I have been happy to notice that this formula creates pretty
good output and generates a nice feeling in all parties involved.</p>

<p>Certainly more study will come on this approach. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>

<h2 id="enough-sleeping:de01faa72149d30f4eb88db96f78a8dd">Enough sleeping</h2>

<p>A few months ago, I got tired of leading <a href="http://greenruby.org">Greenruby</a>
publication and Xenor accepted to jump in and take the publisher role.
I&rsquo;m very grateful about it. But as a secundary effect, I lost that ranting
channel I got used to abuse. Each week, I was getting somehow acustomed
to send some rant with the list of links.</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to get back into a publisher mood. I have various thoughts
that could deserve sharing, or at least, publication. Well I don&rsquo;t tweet much
and I hate facebook, so my media coverage may be a little tiny.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not really a problem. It&rsquo;s not like I have some agenda.
I just wish to exercise my right to reflect aloud on various topics, bring to
the open some personal and/or original thoughts. Nothing more. Whoever reads,
do it in silence.</p>

<h2 id="my-lovely-chatbots-sick-already:eae14584655a9a501cab4772b62674f0">My lovely Chatbots, sick already?</h2>

<p>Recently I have been to a meetup about chatbots. I was expecting something
technical. But it seems that I was totally mislead on what chatbots are. They
are visibly now more of a marketing tool than just a cool piece of technology.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty convinced that web interfaces are going to die slowly in favor of
more conversational interfaces. But in past technology shift we had some time
between appearance and marketability. Like with the web, the social networks,
etc. No more. Chatbots are immediate slaves for sales volumes. All the
blooming of new services for &lsquo;building your own bot&rsquo; are just totally geared
towards customers management and acquisition.</p>

<p>My naive assumption was that assistive conversational interface could have a
larger scope. But well, the market is driven by what sells, and what sells is
what make more sales. I just hope it will have a nice border effect to improve
chatbots as a tool or as a general interface to access information.</p>

<p>But my instinct warns me against the potential invasion of our social world
online by all sort of aggressive automated peddlers. The same way we get
robotic phone calls. Chatbots are going to be the new color of spam?</p>

<h2 id="is-facebook-the-new-npm:33c6cbaaffa1f33ba49e5064e8787b21">Is Facebook the new NPM?</h2>

<p>This week there is a lot of noise in the JS ecosystem, on various trends. But
the most noticeable is about <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a>. Yet another package manager for js,
that states it opens a war against NPM (in soft terms but clearly enough). The
<a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/1840075619545360">long post from Facebook</a> about it demonstrates a clear effort to push
things forward about NPM shortcomings. The reaction on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12684980">hacker news</a>
is pretty verbose.</p>

<p>It provoked a public <a href="http://blog.npmjs.org/post/151660845210/hello-yarn">response from NPM</a> to try to explain that, nop,
it&rsquo;s not a war. But I keep feeling that Facebook is slowly taking over another
piece of the javascript world. For now, it doesn&rsquo;t seem harmful at all, but my
instinct lights a various number of warning bonfires.</p>

<p>But for real, it was more than time that the supremacy of NPM was questioned.
It has a lot of flaws and the number of posts about this event proves that the
community was kind of waiting for something like this to happen. Like this
<a href="https://shift.infinite.red/npm-vs-yarn-cheat-sheet-8755b092e5cc#.d5wnp2yf9">cheatsheet</a>, various articles like <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3130179/javascript/facebook-spins-yarn-to-replace-npm-packager.html">this one</a>, this
enthusiastic post from <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2016/10/11/im-excited-to-work-on-yarn-the-new-js-package-manager-2/">Yehuda Kats</a>. But <a href="https://medium.com/@boennemann/questions-i-wish-yarn-had-answered-on-day-1-ec0db7458107#.r1kyqfnwr">not everybody is happy</a>
about how things are done.</p>

<p>Personally, I like the technical direction it takes. But I hope that like
io.js went back to node.js, it will eventually merge back to NPM, really. But
I have the feeling it is not going to happen.</p>

<h2 id="the-js-toolback-hell:151a80b7575169c1b4c5c3e795aacfee">The JS toolback hell</h2>

<p>This week I laughed a lot while reading <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.pl6hx94d3">How it feels to learn JavaScript in
2016</a>. That article had a pretty <a href="http://www.macwright.org/2016/10/04/everything-is-fine-with-javascript.html">good response</a>, like it hits a
nerve.</p>

<p>But seriously it&rsquo;s clear that we are at a transition time in Javascript
evolution, and there is a huge chaos of possible alternatives to everything.
It feels like an ecosystem where the natural selection didn&rsquo;t operate its
magic yet. It&rsquo;s like there are things in suspension that are going to fall in
order at some point eventually.</p>

<p>My personal bet is that things like elm will win the race, because with its
embrace of functional programming it seems like it opens the door to
interpretation with yet-to-be-written faster and more direct compilers (rather
than transpiling to js). But that&rsquo;s just a hunch.</p>

<p>In the while, front-end craft is now a wizard arcane art. It can&rsquo;t be acquired
by pure reasoning and logic, or reading a doc. You need the map of the
landscape for knowing the possible choices and alternative intermediary
solutions. For part-time front-end people, it&rsquo;s just hell. For now.</p>

<p>Great occasion to kick thunderbird byebye and spend some time on configuring
my mutt to make it real again, after 6 years of click-click for mail. I was a
mutt user for a very long time, and my pause for trying a GUI mail client just
had to have an end. But the mail has clearly become something else now.
Actually much more volume, but much more automated things, and news feeds. Or
it&rsquo;s just me?</p>
