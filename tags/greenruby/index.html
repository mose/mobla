            <div class="post-description">
              <p>Today I&rsquo;m closing <a href="http://greenruby.org">Green Ruby</a>. That newsletter, started on february 2013,
has been a self-imposed weekly duty for more than 4 years. I take a lot
of pride not to have missed one single week during those 225 weeks.</p>

<p>But now that we decided, my friends and I, to put it to an end, there is an
interesting question popping up. What will happen with the list of 2,000 subscribers?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s common knowledge that nowadays, when you don&rsquo;t pay for a service, you are the product.
But honestly, I hate this statement, however relevant it may be.
It eludes any possibility of generosity, and any chance to enjoy a gift economy.
Open source software is an example of this.
You don&rsquo;t pay for it, but by using it, you are not used as an asset or a resource.</p>

<p>So as a symbolic gesture of rebellion, I decided that, by ending the publication,
I will delete the list of subscribers. Forever.</p>

<p>I always felt raped when I subscribe to a service under a certain context, and then
the service provider gets acquired by another company and my account gets automatically
transferred. The contract changes, I have agreed to the initial setup, but why presume
I would automatically agree to any other context? This is the real annoyance in
that user-as-a-product thing. You are not considered as a thinking being anymore.</p>

<p>I hate this!</p>

<p>So the deletion of that list of email is a symbolic sacrifice. Why did you invest all
that time and effort during those 4 years then, will you ask me? Well, I was willing
to contribute to a common interest, out of generosity and love for my peers and friends.
Why should I need a money-related reason? Money kills the social link, it neutralize
the unmeasurable debt that we establish between each others as a community.</p>

<p>A society without generosity, is a society of isolated people. Gifts creates a feeling of debt,
that debt is a bond. If the gift is not personal, it relates you to a community.
Never forget about it. Pay it forward.</p>

<h2 id="my-lovely-chatbots-sick-already:eae14584655a9a501cab4772b62674f0">My lovely Chatbots, sick already?</h2>

<p>Recently I have been to a meetup about chatbots. I was expecting something
technical. But it seems that I was totally mislead on what chatbots are. They
are visibly now more of a marketing tool than just a cool piece of technology.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty convinced that web interfaces are going to die slowly in favor of
more conversational interfaces. But in past technology shift we had some time
between appearance and marketability. Like with the web, the social networks,
etc. No more. Chatbots are immediate slaves for sales volumes. All the
blooming of new services for &lsquo;building your own bot&rsquo; are just totally geared
towards customers management and acquisition.</p>

<p>My naive assumption was that assistive conversational interface could have a
larger scope. But well, the market is driven by what sells, and what sells is
what make more sales. I just hope it will have a nice border effect to improve
chatbots as a tool or as a general interface to access information.</p>

<p>But my instinct warns me against the potential invasion of our social world
online by all sort of aggressive automated peddlers. The same way we get
robotic phone calls. Chatbots are going to be the new color of spam?</p>

<h2 id="is-facebook-the-new-npm:33c6cbaaffa1f33ba49e5064e8787b21">Is Facebook the new NPM?</h2>

<p>This week there is a lot of noise in the JS ecosystem, on various trends. But
the most noticeable is about <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a>. Yet another package manager for js,
that states it opens a war against NPM (in soft terms but clearly enough). The
<a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/1840075619545360">long post from Facebook</a> about it demonstrates a clear effort to push
things forward about NPM shortcomings. The reaction on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12684980">hacker news</a>
is pretty verbose.</p>

<p>It provoked a public <a href="http://blog.npmjs.org/post/151660845210/hello-yarn">response from NPM</a> to try to explain that, nop,
it&rsquo;s not a war. But I keep feeling that Facebook is slowly taking over another
piece of the javascript world. For now, it doesn&rsquo;t seem harmful at all, but my
instinct lights a various number of warning bonfires.</p>

<p>But for real, it was more than time that the supremacy of NPM was questioned.
It has a lot of flaws and the number of posts about this event proves that the
community was kind of waiting for something like this to happen. Like this
<a href="https://shift.infinite.red/npm-vs-yarn-cheat-sheet-8755b092e5cc#.d5wnp2yf9">cheatsheet</a>, various articles like <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3130179/javascript/facebook-spins-yarn-to-replace-npm-packager.html">this one</a>, this
enthusiastic post from <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2016/10/11/im-excited-to-work-on-yarn-the-new-js-package-manager-2/">Yehuda Kats</a>. But <a href="https://medium.com/@boennemann/questions-i-wish-yarn-had-answered-on-day-1-ec0db7458107#.r1kyqfnwr">not everybody is happy</a>
about how things are done.</p>

<p>Personally, I like the technical direction it takes. But I hope that like
io.js went back to node.js, it will eventually merge back to NPM, really. But
I have the feeling it is not going to happen.</p>

<h2 id="the-js-toolback-hell:151a80b7575169c1b4c5c3e795aacfee">The JS toolback hell</h2>

<p>This week I laughed a lot while reading <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.pl6hx94d3">How it feels to learn JavaScript in
2016</a>. That article had a pretty <a href="http://www.macwright.org/2016/10/04/everything-is-fine-with-javascript.html">good response</a>, like it hits a
nerve.</p>

<p>But seriously it&rsquo;s clear that we are at a transition time in Javascript
evolution, and there is a huge chaos of possible alternatives to everything.
It feels like an ecosystem where the natural selection didn&rsquo;t operate its
magic yet. It&rsquo;s like there are things in suspension that are going to fall in
order at some point eventually.</p>

<p>My personal bet is that things like elm will win the race, because with its
embrace of functional programming it seems like it opens the door to
interpretation with yet-to-be-written faster and more direct compilers (rather
than transpiling to js). But that&rsquo;s just a hunch.</p>

<p>In the while, front-end craft is now a wizard arcane art. It can&rsquo;t be acquired
by pure reasoning and logic, or reading a doc. You need the map of the
landscape for knowing the possible choices and alternative intermediary
solutions. For part-time front-end people, it&rsquo;s just hell. For now.</p>

<p>Great occasion to kick thunderbird byebye and spend some time on configuring
my mutt to make it real again, after 6 years of click-click for mail. I was a
mutt user for a very long time, and my pause for trying a GUI mail client just
had to have an end. But the mail has clearly become something else now.
Actually much more volume, but much more automated things, and news feeds. Or
it&rsquo;s just me?</p>

<h2 id="a-stress-free-life:210225183e37db0ce5a2649da43cbec4">A stress-free life</h2>

<p>Next friday, I&rsquo;ve been told that I have to stop working for 2 weeks. Well, for
people that have a normal life and/or kids, it&rsquo;s a pretty good news. For
people that get heavy pressure from their work, it can give some air. But I
wondered why I didn&rsquo;t feel like I ever felt the need for holidays. I take them
by principle, but I&rsquo;m usually not really eager to get them.</p>

<p>After some consideration, it all sums up to some kind of discipline. I refuse
stress on a daily basis. I want each day at work to be enjoyable and
debt-free. It&rsquo;s a bad news for some category of employers. The same way those
consider it&rsquo;s acceptable to accumulate technical debt, they apply the same
principle on human-life debt. Put people under pressure, get a loan on their
health, that will never be repaid. So, I just refuse pressure, the same way I
would refuse to eat meat if I was really vegetarian (which I am only
part-time).</p>

<p>Really I have more trouble with holidays because they bring a gap in the
continuity of work. You get back and there is a lot to catch up on. I would
prefer to have just one hour work less per day than week-long breaks. But
that&rsquo;s just me. It would be totally different if I wanted to travel for fun or
if I had kids. My case is not reproducible.</p>

<p>But the baseline remains valid. whether you have plans or not for holidays,
they should not be required for having a balanced life. Stress has to be
fought on a daily basis and not by using breaks. Breaks, in such case, are
even more enjoyable, if you have the context for it.</p>

<p>The best way I know to push stress away is to put my efforts into what I do,
in a way that I&rsquo;m self-aware that I&rsquo;m really doing what I can to fulfill my
duties. If someone is not happy about the output, that&rsquo;s their problem not
mine. If it leads to some awkward context, then it&rsquo;s broken and I will reach
out to find a better work context. I apply that principle for more than 20
years now and I can&rsquo;t remember last time I felt stressed.</p>

<h2 id="the-art-of-learning:25cf5a2664fd7aa4f4e5aff03248e656">The art of learning</h2>

<p>In my review this week I read that <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2016/09/14/Old-Geek">Old Geek post</a>, which has a lot
of comments under its feet. This is quite interesting. But I feel there is a
confusion here.</p>

<p>From my experience, age is often related to stagnation. The more you
accumulate, the heavier you are. It&rsquo;s heart-breaking to abandon years of
investment in one type of knowledge. Therefore, generally speaking, older
people are less flexible and less likely to surf on the waves of the new
technologies.</p>

<p>But I can tell you as a fact that this is just a natural human law, that, like
many others, can be bended. Bended by discipline, the same way we overcome our
animal instincts. There are many old practitioners of our skill that became
master in the art of change. The sacred art of eternal learning. The wisdom of
daily questioning of previously acquired knowledge.</p>

<p>Obsolescence is not a question of age, but just a question of personality,
environment and priorities. I know a handful of such oldgeeks that didn&rsquo;t yet
reach their 30&rsquo;s. And personally (in my 49), I won&rsquo;t stop surfing any time
soon. hahaha.</p>

<h2 id="observability-and-digestibility:a97c278ef841935dd0d0e1b0e41782ad">Observability and Digestibility</h2>

<p>This is a word I love. I found it again in a <a href="https://medium.com/production-ready/systems-blindness-and-how-we-deal-with-it-d601fa63b7f4#.ub69zflcv">recent blog post about system blindness</a>
and it reminded me how critical this need is. Our
systems get more and more numerous and small. The reliability and debugging of
a platform now goes into various loops given the multiplication of actors.</p>

<p>Observability should be one core pre-requisite when designing a service
oriented architecture with micro-services. But just having everything plugged
to some ELK is not going to help that much. I feel that there is a new job in
there. Some function that has to be fulfilled. Something to reduce that vast
amount of data into something that makes sense. An intermediary that will
correlate logs from various sources. It would put them together and reduce
them to some meaningful &lsquo;events&rsquo;.</p>

<p>So I think observability is not enough. Digestibility is what makes
observability worth it. Maybe such tools already exist? Hmm, probably in the
containers worlds there is something like that. Is there not?</p>

<h2 id="get-out:7741c696b47b149abfe2c5fda320314d">Get out</h2>

<p>If you only ever have lived in only one country, you really should consider
fixing it. Going <a href="https://inassets1-internationsgmbh.netdna-ssl.com/static/bundles/internationsexpatinsider/pdf/expat_insider_2016_the_internations_survey.pdf">live in another country</a> for some years or more is just
such a way towards a richer life. It&rsquo;s usually easy to recognize people that
are multi-rooted, as they often have an increased depth in their personal
philosophy.</p>

<p>We are lucky, in our craft, to have various opportunities to travel and work
remotely, or for foreign companies. Many of you are already aware of those
benefits. But to the others I can just say this: use this opportunity! Get
out!</p>

<h2 id="to-be-remote-or-not-to-be-remote:1376d8ec44d87fc0206977e0453baca2">To be remote or not to be remote &hellip;</h2>

<p>Earlier this week I read <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-work-from-home-oleg-vishnepolsky">an article on linkedin, deliberately
anti-remote</a>, and a bit later on <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-economics-of-working-remotely-28d4173e16e2#.43ewevr3t">another one very pro-remote on
freecodecamp</a>. I&rsquo;m tempted to think one is the response to the other. But
maybe not.</p>

<p>The fact is that switching to a remote organization is a tricky move. It feels
like the move from monolith to micro-services, honestly. People that make
decisions about it rarely envision the extent of the change. And those change
look similar in nature. Team architecture and software design are not that
foreign. More autonomy for services or people, self-contained activity,
requirement for clear communication channels and protocols, extensive
architecture for monitoring, reporting or just plain visibility, more
debugging tools and processes, and much more.</p>

<p>The same way one will have to think about all those when switching to
microservices, the one that thinks about making his team remote will also have
to consider the exact same parameters. But that is all on the principles.
About the implementation, remote teams really need a strong chat culture, an
easy and transparent logging policy for all communication channels, various
tooling similar to chatops tools for assisting communication activity. Remote
organization also need to have all their processes online, and not need much
(if at all) any synchronous meetings.</p>

<p>From my perspective there are various very beneficial side-effects to make a
team remote. There is more traceability as everything is online and not in
corridors anymore. In some cases that I experienced, it also leads to a less
arbitrary perception on team members, because they can be judged more on
results (if you have measure tools prepared accordingly) than on attitude and
mouth-skills (did you noticed that irl meetings are sometimes just a
mouth-o-cracy?). But it&rsquo;s accurate to say that on a short term, it is more
time consuming. The real benefit rises on the long run.</p>

<p>What I didn&rsquo;t find in any articles on the matter, is the life-cycle dimension.
A software project has a life expectancy, from a business point of view. It&rsquo;s
the same game as with the technical debt. It is acceptable business-wise to
live at credit for a time, until a certain milestone. A lot of projects are
just extended MVPs intended to convince big money that they could deserve some
attention. For such project, you want very fast paced environment. It&rsquo;s easier
to coerce your <s>slaves</s> employees to go above and beyond the
expectations, when in a physical environment. This is a disposable context,
and you can skip team debt as much as technical debt. And you really need
physicality for that purpose.</p>

<p>So, I would say, if a company is not making the move towards remote
organization, maybe there are very good reasons for that. But I will be very
cautious to understand what are the real reasons. They may stink. And if they
are remote, but they just came to it recently, I would be careful about the
tooling they prepared for it.</p>
