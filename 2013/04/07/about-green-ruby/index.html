<p><a href="http://greenruby.org/">Green Ruby</a> is a weekly newsletter that I’m publishing about ruby, rails, javascript and web development in general. I am preparing a website to make it more collective and here is the ‘about’ page, not yet published, but I was thinking it could be interesting to share it before the website is all ready.</p>

<h2 id="genesis:1c34dfda6e65228c3dbbf6fb2d30812e">Genesis</h2>

<p>The Newsletter began in june 2012 from the habit I had to send weekly newsletter in <a href="http://codegreenit.com/">Codegreen</a> for our team to know what is happening in our company,. That was purely a teamwork tool for general transparency. But with time passing I also included there some links to what I was finding around that would be of interest for my geek colleagues.</p>

<p>That CodeGreen Internal newsletter began to be cluttered with various links at the bottom of it. So I decided to separate that links gathering bunch in another newsletter. But then it could also be useful for my friends, out of the scope of our team.</p>

<h2 id="green-birth:1c34dfda6e65228c3dbbf6fb2d30812e">Green Birth</h2>

<p>At that time I had to test <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a> service for one of our projects, so because they offer a free package when volume is not too big, I thought I should just create that newsletter as a public freely available publication.</p>

<p>So in february 2013 I sent the first Green Ruby Newsletter to 3 subscribers. Well, mostly our team :) Then it became a weekly habit, so I got a domain name for it, and organically it’s growing slowly.</p>

<h2 id="the-redactor-gear:1c34dfda6e65228c3dbbf6fb2d30812e">The redactor gear</h2>

<p>Codegreen paid for my <a href="http://newsblur.com/">Newsblur</a> account so I can follow a bunch of feeds. Google reader was my first tool but well, they are closing, and actually Newsblur is much better. It’s open source and the guy that makes it does a great job (too bad it’s in python and not in ruby).</p>

<p>I’m also loading a bunch of podcasts on my phone and after having tried a lot of podcast softwares I’m really happy with <a href="http://www.podkicker.com/">Podkicker</a>, it’s just very convenient and it has all I need with the free version. So in my 40 minutes commuting to go to work, I just get the ears busy. I tried to use <a href="https://gpodder.net/user/mose">Gpodder</a> but it’s not totally perfect and the support in podcast clients is not as good as it should be. So I don’t stick on it, maybe it will evolve and I will get back to it.</p>

<p>But I also get a lot of news by just wandering around on <a href="https://geekli.st/">Geekli.st</a>, on <a href="https://coderbits.com/">Coderbits</a>, hacker news, and I subscribed to a bunch of various newsletters. I also watch teh new gems feeds from <a href="https://twitter.com/RubyGemsAlt">@rubygems-alt</a> and I retweet stuff of interest on <a href="https://twitter.com/cogtw">@cogtw</a> account (those 2 are my alternate twitter identities).</p>

<p>Each week <a href="https://github.com/tubaxenor">William</a> (aka xenor) also sends me a list of links. But I definitely don’t use any facebook feeds. For some reason, this is a place I avoid the most I can.</p>

<h2 id="what-next:1c34dfda6e65228c3dbbf6fb2d30812e">What next ?</h2>

<p>My ambition there is to keep it non-commercial, and change it to be more community driven. The preparation of the letter is eating a big part of my saturdays for the last 13 weeks and I don’t think I can keep up the same pace for long time.</p>

<p>The idea I have about the community driven thing is by engineering some automation on the news gathering (to replace newsblur), have a place where the news can be triaged by various people, a little bit like it is on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> with a vote system. But the gathering won’t limit to blog posts and rss feeds, there would also be podcasts and video feeds. There is now a lot of possibilities in automation on feeds aggregation. I worked on a project that already does that feeds aggregation, named “the Blux”. And I expect to replicate parts of it for my Green Ruby Engine.</p>

<p>But also, as usual, this project is also an occasion to play with recent technologies or stuff I want to know more about, otherwise where is the fun ? So here comes <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>, on the top of <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> with <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">mongoDB</a>, and there will be much more on the road (thinking about trying <a href="http://af83.github.io/sponges/">Sponges</a> too).</p>
