<h2 id="interview-based-knowledge-sharing:1b8340b7f1acd4b3212e7dd40ccc3d0c">Interview-based knowledge sharing</h2>

<p>For years I noticed the difficulty to extract decent information from
developers and craftsmen about their work. Developers clearly lack the
skill or the taste for documentation. It extends to the specifications,
which also provides an occasion to notice bad performance.</p>

<p>To work this around, specialized project managers have to fill this role,
but it can create a gap between developers ownership and the final result.
Sometimes luck creates the inspiration and developers produce a decent
amount of documentation. But honestly, this is pure luck, and not a rule.</p>

<p>I found a way to mitigate this issue, that I began to experiment some time
ago at work. It&rsquo;s based on a recorded interaction between a project person and
a person of the craft.</p>

<p>Here are the rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>the project person organizes interviews with stakeholders from all specialties
including developers, business people, operations people, sometimes users,
the more diverse population possible. But it can also be done for no reason
for sharing a certain kind of knowledge with an expert.</li>
<li>interviews take place by written interactive communication in a chat,
in a way that enables logging (irc, slack, whatever)</li>
<li>it lasts 20 minutes more or less, but the format can extend to hours if the need is felt</li>
<li>once the interview is finished, the interviewer cleans up the logs, removes out of topic
details, fixes typoes, removes elements that are purely belonging to the chat way of communication</li>
<li>the cleaned log is reviewed by the interviewee for consensual agreement on its publication</li>
<li>the log can then be added to whatever project space is dedicated to the topic at hand
(documentation, specification annexes, study, paper)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are various beneficial side effects to this endeavor:</p>

<ul>
<li>actors have a better feeling of engagement in the project or topic at hand</li>
<li>it creates a bond between actors, facilitates future exchanges</li>
<li>it gives an equal chance for everyone to speak, even the shy ones, because the 1 to 1
context is much less frightening. In a meeting, there are people that never speak.
Are they stupid? they are not!</li>
<li>it creates content that can be shared with other actors so that they have a better
chance to understand the point of views of other parties.</li>
<li>it creates a useful reference for the project, a raw material which can be annexed
and can be used for summaries. It also creates more content for an eventual search engine
if the publication space has one.</li>
<li>there is less risk to cite someone out of context because the full context is provided.</li>
<li>it is much easier to organize interviews or hold them on the fly than setup meetings.</li>
<li>there is no feeling of loss of time like in a meeting: the time dedicated is intense
and very interactive, there is no waste.</li>
</ul>

<p>I had the occasion to try that technique in a context where internal communication is
not optimal, for knowledge sharing at first, then for exploring options on a new project
and set up specifications. I have been happy to notice that this formula creates pretty
good output and generates a nice feeling in all parties involved.</p>

<p>Certainly more study will come on this approach. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>

<h2 id="enough-sleeping:de01faa72149d30f4eb88db96f78a8dd">Enough sleeping</h2>

<p>A few months ago, I got tired of leading <a href="http://greenruby.org">Greenruby</a>
publication and Xenor accepted to jump in and take the publisher role.
I&rsquo;m very grateful about it. But as a secundary effect, I lost that ranting
channel I got used to abuse. Each week, I was getting somehow acustomed
to send some rant with the list of links.</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to get back into a publisher mood. I have various thoughts
that could deserve sharing, or at least, publication. Well I don&rsquo;t tweet much
and I hate facebook, so my media coverage may be a little tiny.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not really a problem. It&rsquo;s not like I have some agenda.
I just wish to exercise my right to reflect aloud on various topics, bring to
the open some personal and/or original thoughts. Nothing more. Whoever reads,
do it in silence.</p>

<h2 id="my-lovely-chatbots-sick-already:eae14584655a9a501cab4772b62674f0">My lovely Chatbots, sick already?</h2>

<p>Recently I have been to a meetup about chatbots. I was expecting something
technical. But it seems that I was totally mislead on what chatbots are. They
are visibly now more of a marketing tool than just a cool piece of technology.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty convinced that web interfaces are going to die slowly in favor of
more conversational interfaces. But in past technology shift we had some time
between appearance and marketability. Like with the web, the social networks,
etc. No more. Chatbots are immediate slaves for sales volumes. All the
blooming of new services for &lsquo;building your own bot&rsquo; are just totally geared
towards customers management and acquisition.</p>

<p>My naive assumption was that assistive conversational interface could have a
larger scope. But well, the market is driven by what sells, and what sells is
what make more sales. I just hope it will have a nice border effect to improve
chatbots as a tool or as a general interface to access information.</p>

<p>But my instinct warns me against the potential invasion of our social world
online by all sort of aggressive automated peddlers. The same way we get
robotic phone calls. Chatbots are going to be the new color of spam?</p>

<h2 id="is-facebook-the-new-npm:33c6cbaaffa1f33ba49e5064e8787b21">Is Facebook the new NPM?</h2>

<p>This week there is a lot of noise in the JS ecosystem, on various trends. But
the most noticeable is about <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a>. Yet another package manager for js,
that states it opens a war against NPM (in soft terms but clearly enough). The
<a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/1840075619545360">long post from Facebook</a> about it demonstrates a clear effort to push
things forward about NPM shortcomings. The reaction on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12684980">hacker news</a>
is pretty verbose.</p>

<p>It provoked a public <a href="http://blog.npmjs.org/post/151660845210/hello-yarn">response from NPM</a> to try to explain that, nop,
it&rsquo;s not a war. But I keep feeling that Facebook is slowly taking over another
piece of the javascript world. For now, it doesn&rsquo;t seem harmful at all, but my
instinct lights a various number of warning bonfires.</p>

<p>But for real, it was more than time that the supremacy of NPM was questioned.
It has a lot of flaws and the number of posts about this event proves that the
community was kind of waiting for something like this to happen. Like this
<a href="https://shift.infinite.red/npm-vs-yarn-cheat-sheet-8755b092e5cc#.d5wnp2yf9">cheatsheet</a>, various articles like <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3130179/javascript/facebook-spins-yarn-to-replace-npm-packager.html">this one</a>, this
enthusiastic post from <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2016/10/11/im-excited-to-work-on-yarn-the-new-js-package-manager-2/">Yehuda Kats</a>. But <a href="https://medium.com/@boennemann/questions-i-wish-yarn-had-answered-on-day-1-ec0db7458107#.r1kyqfnwr">not everybody is happy</a>
about how things are done.</p>

<p>Personally, I like the technical direction it takes. But I hope that like
io.js went back to node.js, it will eventually merge back to NPM, really. But
I have the feeling it is not going to happen.</p>

<h2 id="the-js-toolback-hell:151a80b7575169c1b4c5c3e795aacfee">The JS toolback hell</h2>

<p>This week I laughed a lot while reading <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.pl6hx94d3">How it feels to learn JavaScript in
2016</a>. That article had a pretty <a href="http://www.macwright.org/2016/10/04/everything-is-fine-with-javascript.html">good response</a>, like it hits a
nerve.</p>

<p>But seriously it&rsquo;s clear that we are at a transition time in Javascript
evolution, and there is a huge chaos of possible alternatives to everything.
It feels like an ecosystem where the natural selection didn&rsquo;t operate its
magic yet. It&rsquo;s like there are things in suspension that are going to fall in
order at some point eventually.</p>

<p>My personal bet is that things like elm will win the race, because with its
embrace of functional programming it seems like it opens the door to
interpretation with yet-to-be-written faster and more direct compilers (rather
than transpiling to js). But that&rsquo;s just a hunch.</p>

<p>In the while, front-end craft is now a wizard arcane art. It can&rsquo;t be acquired
by pure reasoning and logic, or reading a doc. You need the map of the
landscape for knowing the possible choices and alternative intermediary
solutions. For part-time front-end people, it&rsquo;s just hell. For now.</p>

<p>Great occasion to kick thunderbird byebye and spend some time on configuring
my mutt to make it real again, after 6 years of click-click for mail. I was a
mutt user for a very long time, and my pause for trying a GUI mail client just
had to have an end. But the mail has clearly become something else now.
Actually much more volume, but much more automated things, and news feeds. Or
it&rsquo;s just me?</p>

<h2 id="a-stress-free-life:210225183e37db0ce5a2649da43cbec4">A stress-free life</h2>

<p>Next friday, I&rsquo;ve been told that I have to stop working for 2 weeks. Well, for
people that have a normal life and/or kids, it&rsquo;s a pretty good news. For
people that get heavy pressure from their work, it can give some air. But I
wondered why I didn&rsquo;t feel like I ever felt the need for holidays. I take them
by principle, but I&rsquo;m usually not really eager to get them.</p>

<p>After some consideration, it all sums up to some kind of discipline. I refuse
stress on a daily basis. I want each day at work to be enjoyable and
debt-free. It&rsquo;s a bad news for some category of employers. The same way those
consider it&rsquo;s acceptable to accumulate technical debt, they apply the same
principle on human-life debt. Put people under pressure, get a loan on their
health, that will never be repaid. So, I just refuse pressure, the same way I
would refuse to eat meat if I was really vegetarian (which I am only
part-time).</p>

<p>Really I have more trouble with holidays because they bring a gap in the
continuity of work. You get back and there is a lot to catch up on. I would
prefer to have just one hour work less per day than week-long breaks. But
that&rsquo;s just me. It would be totally different if I wanted to travel for fun or
if I had kids. My case is not reproducible.</p>

<p>But the baseline remains valid. whether you have plans or not for holidays,
they should not be required for having a balanced life. Stress has to be
fought on a daily basis and not by using breaks. Breaks, in such case, are
even more enjoyable, if you have the context for it.</p>

<p>The best way I know to push stress away is to put my efforts into what I do,
in a way that I&rsquo;m self-aware that I&rsquo;m really doing what I can to fulfill my
duties. If someone is not happy about the output, that&rsquo;s their problem not
mine. If it leads to some awkward context, then it&rsquo;s broken and I will reach
out to find a better work context. I apply that principle for more than 20
years now and I can&rsquo;t remember last time I felt stressed.</p>

<h2 id="the-art-of-learning:25cf5a2664fd7aa4f4e5aff03248e656">The art of learning</h2>

<p>In my review this week I read that <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2016/09/14/Old-Geek">Old Geek post</a>, which has a lot
of comments under its feet. This is quite interesting. But I feel there is a
confusion here.</p>

<p>From my experience, age is often related to stagnation. The more you
accumulate, the heavier you are. It&rsquo;s heart-breaking to abandon years of
investment in one type of knowledge. Therefore, generally speaking, older
people are less flexible and less likely to surf on the waves of the new
technologies.</p>

<p>But I can tell you as a fact that this is just a natural human law, that, like
many others, can be bended. Bended by discipline, the same way we overcome our
animal instincts. There are many old practitioners of our skill that became
master in the art of change. The sacred art of eternal learning. The wisdom of
daily questioning of previously acquired knowledge.</p>

<p>Obsolescence is not a question of age, but just a question of personality,
environment and priorities. I know a handful of such oldgeeks that didn&rsquo;t yet
reach their 30&rsquo;s. And personally (in my 49), I won&rsquo;t stop surfing any time
soon. hahaha.</p>

<h2 id="observability-and-digestibility:a97c278ef841935dd0d0e1b0e41782ad">Observability and Digestibility</h2>

<p>This is a word I love. I found it again in a <a href="https://medium.com/production-ready/systems-blindness-and-how-we-deal-with-it-d601fa63b7f4#.ub69zflcv">recent blog post about system blindness</a>
and it reminded me how critical this need is. Our
systems get more and more numerous and small. The reliability and debugging of
a platform now goes into various loops given the multiplication of actors.</p>

<p>Observability should be one core pre-requisite when designing a service
oriented architecture with micro-services. But just having everything plugged
to some ELK is not going to help that much. I feel that there is a new job in
there. Some function that has to be fulfilled. Something to reduce that vast
amount of data into something that makes sense. An intermediary that will
correlate logs from various sources. It would put them together and reduce
them to some meaningful &lsquo;events&rsquo;.</p>

<p>So I think observability is not enough. Digestibility is what makes
observability worth it. Maybe such tools already exist? Hmm, probably in the
containers worlds there is something like that. Is there not?</p>

<h2 id="get-out:7741c696b47b149abfe2c5fda320314d">Get out</h2>

<p>If you only ever have lived in only one country, you really should consider
fixing it. Going <a href="https://inassets1-internationsgmbh.netdna-ssl.com/static/bundles/internationsexpatinsider/pdf/expat_insider_2016_the_internations_survey.pdf">live in another country</a> for some years or more is just
such a way towards a richer life. It&rsquo;s usually easy to recognize people that
are multi-rooted, as they often have an increased depth in their personal
philosophy.</p>

<p>We are lucky, in our craft, to have various opportunities to travel and work
remotely, or for foreign companies. Many of you are already aware of those
benefits. But to the others I can just say this: use this opportunity! Get
out!</p>
