            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>This week there is a lot of noise in the JS ecosystem, on various trends. But
the most noticeable is about <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a>. Yet another package manager for js,
that states it opens a war against NPM (in soft terms but clearly enough). The
<a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/1840075619545360">long post from Facebook</a> about it demonstrates a clear effort to push
things forward about NPM shortcomings. The reaction on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12684980">hacker news</a>
is pretty verbose.</p>

<p>It provoked a public <a href="http://blog.npmjs.org/post/151660845210/hello-yarn">response from NPM</a> to try to explain that, nop,
it&rsquo;s not a war. But I keep feeling that Facebook is slowly taking over another
piece of the javascript world. For now, it doesn&rsquo;t seem harmful at all, but my
instinct lights a various number of warning bonfires.</p>

<p>But for real, it was more than time that the supremacy of NPM was questioned.
It has a lot of flaws and the number of posts about this event proves that the
community was kind of waiting for something like this to happen. Like this
<a href="https://shift.infinite.red/npm-vs-yarn-cheat-sheet-8755b092e5cc#.d5wnp2yf9">cheatsheet</a>, various articles like <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3130179/javascript/facebook-spins-yarn-to-replace-npm-packager.html">this one</a>, this
enthusiastic post from <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2016/10/11/im-excited-to-work-on-yarn-the-new-js-package-manager-2/">Yehuda Kats</a>. But <a href="https://medium.com/@boennemann/questions-i-wish-yarn-had-answered-on-day-1-ec0db7458107#.r1kyqfnwr">not everybody is happy</a>
about how things are done.</p>

<p>Personally, I like the technical direction it takes. But I hope that like
io.js went back to node.js, it will eventually merge back to NPM, really. But
I have the feeling it is not going to happen.</p>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>This week I laughed a lot while reading <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.pl6hx94d3">How it feels to learn JavaScript in
2016</a>. That article had a pretty <a href="http://www.macwright.org/2016/10/04/everything-is-fine-with-javascript.html">good response</a>, like it hits a
nerve.</p>

<p>But seriously it&rsquo;s clear that we are at a transition time in Javascript
evolution, and there is a huge chaos of possible alternatives to everything.
It feels like an ecosystem where the natural selection didn&rsquo;t operate its
magic yet. It&rsquo;s like there are things in suspension that are going to fall in
order at some point eventually.</p>

<p>My personal bet is that things like elm will win the race, because with its
embrace of functional programming it seems like it opens the door to
interpretation with yet-to-be-written faster and more direct compilers (rather
than transpiling to js). But that&rsquo;s just a hunch.</p>

<p>In the while, front-end craft is now a wizard arcane art. It can&rsquo;t be acquired
by pure reasoning and logic, or reading a doc. You need the map of the
landscape for knowing the possible choices and alternative intermediary
solutions. For part-time front-end people, it&rsquo;s just hell. For now.</p>

              <p>There have been some noise last week about npm, coming from <a href="https://medium.com/@azerbike/i-ve-just-liberated-my-modules-9045c06be67c#.evxywifiu">that article</a>.
It merely revealed that various open source
organization are privately held by some individuals and they can either be
pressured or take weird decisions. Honestly I consider this incident
anecdotal. It&rsquo;s not the first time such thing happens. One guy just happened
to be very vocal and pissed off about it.</p>

<p>And it carried various threads of discussion on Twitter and elsewhere, in a
huge controversy. There were many points raised. NPM has thousands and
thousands of packages, and many of them are just a few lines of utility
library, so it was a good occasion for some to point out that you should
reduce your number of dependencies. Others pointed out that namespacing could
help prevent such situation, like it&rsquo;s done in docker or in go (having
username/somelib instead of somelib) following the github convention.</p>

<p>All in all, it appears that open source is gaining its traction from being
free of any legal duty. Or at least there is no formal contracting, no
by-laws, on committees or advisors. People do how they feel in the limits of
some very simple basic licensing rules. Some organization provide a more
structured legal asset but they usually are on the side and purposed for
channeling money management, not necessarily patents and intellectual
property.</p>

<p>My opinion is that this kind of friction between businesses and open source is
going to happen more and more. But I wonder how it&rsquo;s going to turn out.</p>

            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been playing with Hubot plugins code in coffeescript for our
company. That&rsquo;s a while I didn&rsquo;t do much js but I used it for a long time and
I didn&rsquo;t find it too difficult to catch up. But for some reason, it brought me
the same feeling I have each time I get back to that language. I feel dirty.
Still I can do what I need to do, for sure, but I don&rsquo;t feel like a builder,
more like an acrobat. And I&rsquo;m far from a purist.</p>

<p>Some people talk about javascript taking over the world. But that language
imho just was there at the right place at the right time. By having a runtime
embedded in browsers and browsers libraries, it has been used to hijack the
most used software on our computers and mobile devices, to transform them into
richer clients. Along the way various layers were added to fulfill the need of
software design, because javascript initial goal was merely DOM manipulation.</p>

<p>The thing that always stroke me the most with javascript is that despite the
efforts from ecmascript, it has no formal standard or documentation. It is
pretty extensively documented, of course, but because the language is pushed
forward by the implementations rather than from a standard body, it gets a bit
messy.</p>

<p>I saw a <a href="http://cube-drone.com/comics/c/relentless-persistence">drawing</a> this week that illustrates the mess quite well. It feels
like Javascript is waiting for something to come replace it.</p>

<p>But there is hope with ES6. Seems like in recent years the normative effort on
the ecmascript standard got some more traction and some more press coverage.
But I personally don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to bring the solution. I enjoyed
reading the <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/future-programming-webassembly-life-after-javascript/">thoughts of Eric Elliot</a> on that topic but I&rsquo;m not sure
he&rsquo;s right on everything. But what he&rsquo;s right about, is that there will be an
after-javascript.</p>

<p>Unless that after javascript doesn&rsquo;t arrive fast enough and gets useless by
some new programming paradigm that may appear one day soon. I mean, in the
next 10 years. At some point, like big data is too complex to be handled by
human, programming will also get too complex and will be handled by
algorithms. We already <a href="http://phys.org/news/2015-07-code-faster-expert.html">see it coming</a>. And all programmers will then
become high end workflow designers or just play with antiquities.</p>

<p>In this perspective, I think javascript is a great intermediary technology for
the time being, given its pervasive aspect. It&rsquo;s far from satisfying, but it
does the job. But the younger generation should keep an eye on higher level
abstract approaches, like systems architectures, workflow logics, organization
patterns, because imho that will drive software design in the next 10-20
years.</p>
