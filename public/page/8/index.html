<h2 id="multiple-inheritance-simulation:a9a546e37849f6a570839940ccf98c98">Multiple inheritance simulation</h2>

<p>This is a bit twisted. In ruby, as you know, you cannot use multiple
inheritance. But the flexibility of the language, especially the
metaprogramming aspect, opens the door for some cheating. Check out
<a href="https://gist.github.com/capitalist/473543b7ea24d461d030">this code</a>, it tricks it by declaring the first class as the super
class and the remaining classes as modules included in that super class.
Pretty acrobatic and elegant, imho.</p>

<h2 id="about-vaping:a9a546e37849f6a570839940ccf98c98">About vaping</h2>

<p>Well this has been my burden for 30 years, and I&rsquo;m not proud of it. But last
week it finally ended. I quit smoking. But this was kindof a trick, as it was
made possible by switching to <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5-facts-that-everyone-gets-wrong-about-vaping-1659938937">vaping</a>. It certainly doesn&rsquo;t solve the
nicotine addiction issue, but I&rsquo;m very happy with this move and hopeful for a
gradual freedom.</p>

<p>I also found out that this vaping practice is very geeky. The hardware part is
quite elaborate, vaping devices are really neat piece of work, there are a
bunch of vendors. The liquidware is also quite a subject of hacking.
Technically it&rsquo;s not that hard to do it yourself. Not surprising that I
discovered this vaping practice in geeks circles.</p>

<p>We had this week a very productive meeting with xenor and tysliu in our
preferred coffee shop. I explained more in detail my workflow and my quality
criterias. So now they can feed the links section and become the major editors
of Green Ruby. I Still keep the role of the publisher. I get their links, I
clean up stuff, verify freshness and reachability, remove superlatives, fix
category if needed.</p>

<p>Special thanks a lot to Xenor and Tysliu (aka. Simon). Now they do the heavy
lifting and they are the reason why Green Ruby is still in your mailbox every
week.</p>

<h2 id="drones-and-makers:84bb7b31097e7dff868fbef479daafb5">Drones and makers</h2>

<p>This is now obvious. We are going to get invaded by drones. Of course we will
pretend we control them, for a while. But I can bet it&rsquo;s not going to stand
too long. Their autonomy is a competitive factor, and, in our current society,
competitive is the Darwinian selective factor. It can be a bit scary.</p>

<p>But on another hand, when we geeks look at those things with our (never-aging)
kids eyes, we see fun toys. Look at the <a href="http://www.bgobeyond.co.uk/">B Flying car</a>. We can
<a href="http://diydrones.com/">do them ourselves</a>. Like we were able to tinker with the first computers, the
first radio stations. But now we have 3D printing. Yet not that affordable,
but it seems to get better. There is also that creepy <a href="http://the3doodler.com/">3Doodler</a>
thingie, and various other new techniques.</p>

<p>Maybe the Makers movement is the hope for humanity. Reclaim the daily small
things! Check that <a href="http://www.instructables.com/">instructable</a> website it&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Well yeah this all has nothing to do with webdev. Except from the fact that
open standards made possible to people like me to do the web myself. After a
time, it became a professional activity. Will we get professional makers in
the future and see a revival of craftsmanship? I really wonder.</p>

<h2 id="time-to-upgrade:d4567cfa55308712270d1f5b73098130">Time to upgrade</h2>

<p>This is a long time I plan to re-engineer the way Green Ruby is produced. Last
week I told Xenor and Simon I was thinking about giving it a break. I&rsquo;m not
that much anymore in the flow. Now my days are full ops and not that much dev.
But the guys didn&rsquo;t want to let me stop.</p>

<p>So we are going to organize things a little differently. Xenor and Simon,
which are full time rails developers, are going to handle the content more
extensively, and I will just manage the publication, plus some devops links.
So we need to get some tools ready to handle that new flow. Maybe, the time it
gets ready, we will take some time off. Maybe not.</p>

<p>What I wish is to have a way to let more people jump in, too. Maybe we will
get inspiration in how <a href="http://thechangelog.com/trello-as-a-cms/">the changelog</a> manages their news
flow. They based it on a <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> and it&rsquo;s quite clever. By chance I
explored the trello API recently and I can tell it&rsquo;s really good, very
suitable for custom automation.</p>

<p>This week, I will play lazy on the podcasts. I don&rsquo;t think they are that much
interesting anyways, and all that copy-pasting is exhausting. When some
podcasts stands out of the crowd, I will rather feature it in this rant.</p>

<h2 id="about-blogging:111d43eaf8a2a6adad496f0417e7f52c">About blogging</h2>

<p>Well, since that whole blogging thing began, I never have been very active on
it. Well, I have a <a href="http://blog.mose.com">blog</a> on Tumblr because I wanted to know how they
are doing it, I published various posts in the <a href="http://devtips.faria.co/authors.html#mose-ref">faria devtips</a>, and
after all, this rant could also count as a publication. So I think I will
gather them all under one unique site. A Jekyll github-pages kind, easy and
cheap.</p>

<p>After all, I&rsquo;m not sure the devtips website will stay up any longer. There
have been no post since the day I left. Too bad. It&rsquo;s a demonstration that
some collective actions can sometimes rely only on the energy of one person.</p>

<p>So, I made a <a href="http://mose.github.io/blog">new repo</a> on github for it, and I will gather whatever
stuff I can find that I wrote in there.</p>

<h2 id="lovely-freebsd:111d43eaf8a2a6adad496f0417e7f52c">Lovely FreeBSD</h2>

<p>At our Gandi office in Taipei I had to install a <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/">pfsense</a> server,
which is based on <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>. It was quite a pleasant experience,
actually. Last time I played a bit with BSD that was 12 years ago, and that
was not very smooth. I&rsquo;m happy to be given that occasion to see how it goes
now.</p>

<p>For now I&rsquo;m going to use it like if it was an <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a> with some
extra <a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source.html">OpenVPN</a> abilities. And it will also be a file server for the
LAN. Not sure yet how I will handle that.</p>

<h2 id="ruby-package-management:111d43eaf8a2a6adad496f0417e7f52c">Ruby package management</h2>

<p>When I got in my new job, I discovered a new way to manage server management.
They didn&rsquo;t want to use <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a>, or even <a href="https://rubygems.org/">ruby gems</a>, or
<a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/">pip</a> or anything that is not debian packages. It may sound quite harsh.
Since I came in ruby in 2010, rvm has been my best friend, bundle the second
one. But this approach is very developer-based. When you maintain large and
stable systems, it&rsquo;s more likely that you will not trust the bleeding edge
stuff and prefer confirmed publication of packages before using them. This is
an interesting slap on my face.</p>

<p>Of course there are the <a href="https://www.brightbox.com/docs/ruby/ubuntu/">brightbox</a> packages for Ubuntu, but that&rsquo;s
missing the point. A release has to be out for a certain time so it can be
strengthened by security reviews and proper production usage. There is a part
of the population for each language that is considering the instability of
current releases a normal trade-off. but there is a huge lot of other
companies that will wait patiently that things get stable enough for their
taste.</p>

<p>Our craft as webdev is clearly in huge demand. This provides an opportunity
for us to travel abroad, discover new cultures, widen our horizon. When I went
to live in Taiwan, I was not worried about finding a job. But when hunting for
a job abroad it can be tricky to find companies that will sponsor a visa, a
work permit, or whatever legal requirement is involved in each countries.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what the new initiative called <a href="http://techmeabroad.com">TechMeAbroad</a> aims to fix, by
listing only job opportunities for which a work permit is sponsored. As
<a href="http://jbarbier42.tumblr.com/post/112155851079/introducing-techmeabroad">Julien Barbier explains</a>, it will launch in march, and if you know of any
job offers that includes a visa or such thing, please let him know (or send it
to me I will pass it along), so we can feed that platform with some real data
quickly.</p>

<h2 id="so-long-ruby-1-9:a0091e7eb1dfeca477447c7e0b2e6425">So long ruby 1.9</h2>

<p>As planned, it&rsquo;s now time to say <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2015/02/23/support-for-ruby-1-9-3-has-ended/">byebye to ruby 1.9.3</a>. But there is still
so many old version of ruby in the wild. In debian squeeze, you gotta use 1.8.
In wheezy, you have 1.9. And there are still many servers that will refuse to
upgrade.</p>

<p>The registration for <a href="http://rubyheroes.com/">Ruby Heroes 2015</a> is now open. Go vote for your
favorite ruby influential dev. You have until <a href="http://railsconf.com/">railsconf</a> that will happen

<p>Here it was Chinese New Year this week. A good occasion for those who are not
familiar with chinese state of the web to read about its <a href="http://designbeep.com/2015/02/20/free-download-chinese-new-year-icon-pack-50-icons/">web design trends 2015</a>.
This article is pretty deep and reflects accurately how China uses

<p>Now that I&rsquo;m working from Taiwan with a French company, I was have been
searching for a decent solution for video conferencing. Because skype and
google-hangouts are just not things I like to use. I found out that new
versions of firefox include by default a one to one webrtc feature, named
<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-hello-video-and-voice-conversations-online">Hello</a>. It works pretty nicely. I also tried out <a href="https://glideroom.com/">Glideroom</a> and
<a href="https://hu.tt/">Hutt</a>. There are also heavier solutions that I tried in the past like the
<a href="http://bigbluebutton.org/">big blue button</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately some dude in the ops team pointed out that webrtc was <a href="https://blog.ipvanish.com/webrtc-security-hole-leaks-real-ip-addresses/">not
secure</a>, so it&rsquo;s not likely to become a standard for us. Hrum, well, that&rsquo;s
debatable how proprietary solutions are more secure. There is no way to get it
figured out. Anyways Webrtc became a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-webrtc-20150210/">w3c standard</a> recently, and the
section 12, named security, says: TBD. Let&rsquo;s hope it will be done properly.</p>

<p>Any of you have some first hand experience with any alternative video
conference system, please send me a mail with your feedback.</p>

<h2 id="damn-omnivore:f97d1953e92cfdfb05d8ef20de1a8b30">Damn omnivore</h2>

<p>Last week Green Ruby was sent with a delay. For some obscure reason my
publication was blocked by <a href="http://mailchimp.com/omnivore/">Omnivore</a> the automated fraud detection system
from Mailchimp. My account was instantly blocked and it was pending a human
review. Of course the human review made it clear that the publication was
clean but it took 2 days and I still don&rsquo;t know why this omnivore beast went
mad at me.</p>

<p>They declare it&rsquo;s getting smarter everyday, but really, we are still safe. The
reign of the intelligent computer over the human species is not close yet.</p>

<h2 id="make-it-static:f97d1953e92cfdfb05d8ef20de1a8b30">Make it static</h2>

<p>Dynamic websites are great. But that&rsquo;s a long time I wonder about the
trade-off. If you update your blog every day, and have 500 visits, your
dynamic setup is useful when you edit, and it&rsquo;s a cost for each visitor. There
are so many web applications that could be more clever about it. Especially
that now the computation is going more and more client side.</p>

<p>Static pages have a really unbeatable response time, their security is really
reliable, they are low dependencies and easy to deploy with a rsync.</p>

<p>When I get to think about making a new website, I always ask myself if it&rsquo;s an
application or a website. For sure some kind of applications are computation
intensive. Making it all dynamic could make sense. But frankly, if it&rsquo;s a
website, it can have some fancy dynamic features without a huge dynamic setup.</p>

<p>I have seen so many websites made with php, mysql, 5 tables and 20 entries in
each. Such site should have pre-generated content, data available as static
json files, as a bit of js to make the magic happen. If there is a lot of
data, fine, an API server makes sense.</p>

<p>So next time you gotta prepare a website, ask yourself how easy it could be to
generate it and use tools like <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>. Or you can even
handle things with custom rake tasks (<a href="https://github.com/greenruby/grn-static/blob/master/lib/builder.rb#L87">like I do for Green Ruby website</a>),
that&rsquo;s not that hard. It&rsquo;s a matter of cyberspace ecology.</p>

<h2 id="ghost:fba0bb1f68d1414085590cced7805ffa">Ghost</h2>

<p>You certainly heard about it, this week there was a new huge Linux
<a href="http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/01/27/9">vulnerability on glibc</a> revealed. Actually it was leaked by a stupid
communication agency few hours before it should have been announced. When such
big bug is discovered usually there is a small period of time where the news
spread into some limited circles. They keep it embargoed until major distro
vendors get patched packages ready. Well, it didn&rsquo;t go that well this time.</p>

<p>This vulnerability is pretty nasty even if less obvious to exploit than
Heartbleed or shellshock, it&rsquo;s probably in the same category. If you manage
servers that are vulnerable (LTS and stable, less up to date versions,
mostly), you better upgrade asap. When a bug gets its own name (this one is
called Ghost), it seems to be the sign it requires immediate attention. How
long is this trick going to work?</p>

<p>And, as we talk about security, Hipchat users should read this (unnamed)
<a href="https://blog.hipchat.com/2015/02/01/hipchat-security-notice-and-password-reset/">security notice</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2-years:fba0bb1f68d1414085590cced7805ffa">2 years</h2>

<p>This edition is marking the 2 years anniversary of Green Ruby. For 104 weeks
I&rsquo;ve been sending out this newsletter every week. Last week I had a discussion
with a friend, he was asking me what was my drive, and what was the reason of
my consistency. Well, there are various reasons.</p>

<p>First there is the routine aspect. It&rsquo;s like practicing Taichi or some kind of
exercise. It keeps the mind fresh, and in this context where things change
pretty fast, enforcing a weekly review gave me an overall feeling of symbiosis
with the wave of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>Second is the philosophy of it: this newsletter is a gift. The ruby world is
very business oriented. There is a lot of open source in there but still the
average spirit is based on a market economy. There are of course many
exceptions, I wanted to be one of them, and I believe a gift economy would be
more my thing. You get rich of what you give away, not always individually,
but most definitely collectively. I like that feeling.</p>

<p>Third, this media keeps me in touch with a bunch of my friends. It&rsquo;s like a
beacon that I send to the people I left behind when I left France to go live
in Taiwan. Or people I worked with in my past jobs in Taiwan, even. They don&rsquo;t
often respond to it but I know they can perceive me through this weekly proof
of existence.</p>

<p>Also, there is the support from xenor and more recently from simon, which, by
sending me a few links each weeks, validate the need to keep things going.</p>

<h2 id="trello-and-irc:fba0bb1f68d1414085590cced7805ffa">Trello and irc</h2>

<p>For as long as I remember, I always have been coding irc bots. In so many
languages. I suspect there is some aspect of this that appeals to me. Maybe
the creation of life-like pattern. Anyways, my last bot was of course in ruby,
I called it <a href="https://github.com/mose/cogbot">cogbot</a>, and is based on the great <a href="https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch">cinch</a> framework. It has
been sleepy for a while, since we were not using irc in Faria.</p>

<p>But Gandi is heavy irc user, and our recent experiments on trello gave me an
occasion to get cogbot out of the dust. As a matter of fact <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> has a
really <a href="https://trello.com/docs/">great API</a>, and also supports webhooks. So I added a trello
listener to cogbot, and it was a lot of fun. Maybe next I will add some cards
creation and update features in that bot, but it requires some kind of users
management, which, on an irc bot, is not that trivial to implement.</p>

<h2 id="free-your-code:fba0bb1f68d1414085590cced7805ffa">Free your code</h2>

<p>Do you have a side project? You should! Maybe the code you produce at work can
be generic enough? This is a call for you to consider freeing your code. Open
source community is plentiful but I know as a fact that 90% of the code that
could be shared is not shared.</p>

<p>There is something I noticed in my own code publication. Often in my work
there are constraints of time that lead to trade-offs and code quality is
never as good as I wish it was. By working on side projects, the pace is much
more relaxed and I can spend hours focusing on non productive efforts to make
my code better. Well, this is not to say that side project code is perfect,
but the environment of producing it brings another mindset. And after a while,
the code produced at work gets naturally more insightful because of this extra
practice.</p>

<p>Give it a try, if you happen to have some free time. If you don&rsquo;t have free
time, you&rsquo;re doing something wrong. But that&rsquo;s another story.</p>

<h2 id="more-screens:d021634982f7dcb44b802e2a3d2040a7">More Screens</h2>

<p>Some time ago, when I left Faria, I bought a laptop with a clear purpose. I
wanted to have on linux the same screen experience that I had with the macbook
pro connected to 2 thunderbolts. So I got an <a href="http://www.asus.com/us/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/ASUS_ZENBOOK_UX301LA/">asus UX301L</a> plus 2
<a href="http://accessories.ap.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=au&amp;cs=audhs1&amp;l=en&amp;redirect=1&amp;s=dhs&amp;sku=210-40773">Dell screens U2713HM</a> who supports a 2560x1440 resolution. The laptop in itself
is amazing, dazzling fast, and all worked well with an ubuntu install. This
was not cheap but that was a while I didn&rsquo;t spend anything on hardware.</p>

<p>I struggled a bit to find the proper connectors so I could enable the extra
large resolution on connected screens. I ended up using the mini-hdmi
connector plus a mini-display port converter to DVI for the second one. And
finally it worked last week. I had to <a href="http://www.arunviswanathan.com/node/53">force the resolution in xrandr</a> and
now I have a damn huge double display for a total of 7680x1440. What a blast!</p>

<h2 id="debian-i3wm-and-urxvt:d021634982f7dcb44b802e2a3d2040a7">Debian, i3wm and urxvt</h2>

<p>Well this is an old story. Some time ago I switched from debian + fvwm2/ion to
ubuntu + cinnamon just because I had to know about it. The goal was to be able
to convince my wife (and some other non-techies) to switch to ubuntu. But I
had to know how it worked on a daily basis. And it was a success for most of
it.</p>

<p>2 years ago at Faria I was given a mac. Well, it was good to know a bit more
about it, my mac knowledge was dating from system 6.7 time. But if the
hardware is really good, the OSX experience didn&rsquo;t really satisfy the geek
that was deep inside me.</p>

<p>Then I got back into a team that is deeply attached to pure linux traditions,
when I joined Gandi. I now switched back to a debian jessie with <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3wm</a> on
my work laptop. Wow this feels good to be back to such a rude but flexible
environment. As a matter of fact all went perfectly well and all the tricks I
knew 10 years ago are still very valid.</p>

<p>I also took that occasion to get back into urxvt, for my terminal emulator.
It&rsquo;s a very badly documented over-powerful tool. But when you get the grasp on
it, possibilities are much more satisfying than with gnome-terminal. I&rsquo;m still
working on <a href="https://github.com/mose/rcfiles/blob/master/.Xdefaults">my configuration</a> to match few features that gnome terminal had
(like font resizing, clipboard management). The <a href="https://github.com/mose/rcfiles/blob/master/.urxvt/ext/notification">notification plugin</a>,
combined with <a href="http://knopwob.org/dunst/index.html">dunst</a>, gives amazing results.</p>

<p>It feels good to be back into the cave. To mark this change, I didn&rsquo;t shave
for 3 months so now I&rsquo;m really bearded like the old-fashioned linux bears.
Muhaha!</p>

<p>PS: no worry, I&rsquo;m still fullstack at heart and I still love ruby!</p>
