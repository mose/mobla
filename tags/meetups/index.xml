      <description>Last week I posted a link about Remote Meetups, but, as it sometimes happens, it didn&amp;rsquo;t stop there. The basic principle was appealing to me. It&amp;rsquo;s true that we don&amp;rsquo;t all live in the Bay area or in New York. Having high quality speakers in meetups is hard when you live in a small city or a remote country. And this is exactly what that initiative tries to address.
So I jumped in and had some talk with Franze.</description>

      <description>While42 This week I got in contact with Sylvain from while42. It&amp;rsquo;s a social network for french tech engineers, but with a special touch on it. There is no facebook page or google group. They intentionally decided to be irl-first. For people that are most likely to be online all the time, this sounds so therapeutic! So, I decided, with Thomas from Gandi, to setup a Taiwan chapter. If you want to know more (and are french, engineer, and living in Taipei) just drop me a mail.</description>
