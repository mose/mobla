Sometimes when doing some mechanical operation on my home workstation, involving repetitive action or something requiring low level of attention (like sorting mails, lurking on irc, updating a distro, â€¦), I like to put the headset and listen to stuff. But I never had any taste for music, I prefer listening to people that talk about some interesting topic.

I began this when starting working with rails, because that was a great flow of information, that had various sources:

- http://rubyrogues.com
- http://rubyshow.com
- http://learn.thoughtbot.com/podcast
- http://ruby5.envylabs.com

All was good and then I checked out podcast clients for my environment (linux with ubuntu) and I found out http://gpodder.net which is exactly the kind of software I like. I does not much but what it does is well done. The website is a nice optional addition, only focused on podcasts and has a nice simple design and is free.

    apt-get install gpodder


Then I discovered a few other podcasts for hackers, or oriented towards science and knowledge. And I removed the rss feed I had in my thunderbird for listening to some French-speaking radio shows (like la-bas si j'y suis).

The website makes possible to publish your subscription list, here is my list of very geeky selection:
