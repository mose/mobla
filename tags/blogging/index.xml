      <description>A few months ago, I got tired of leading Greenruby publication and Xenor accepted to jump in and take the publisher role. I&amp;rsquo;m very grateful about it. But as a secundary effect, I lost that ranting channel I got used to abuse. Each week, I was getting somehow acustomed to send some rant with the list of links.
Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to get back into a publisher mood. I have various thoughts that could deserve sharing, or at least, publication.</description>

      <description>Well, since that whole blogging thing began, I never have been very active on it. Well, I have a blog on Tumblr because I wanted to know how they are doing it, I published various posts in the faria devtips, and after all, this rant could also count as a publication. So I think I will gather them all under one unique site. A Jekyll github-pages kind, easy and cheap.</description>
