## No rant this week

Well it's not the first time. I just don't feel inspired. So I better shut up
rather than writing useless rant. It's so easy to fill up space with
meaningless content. But I'm not doing that ever. I only speak out when I have
something to say. And yes, I'm very comfortable to contradict myself by
writing a useless rant. This is the beauty of the human being: our ability to
abstract makes possible all sort of paradoxes. Wait, is it related to
abstractions? hmm, This is a great topic for my day-dreaming in the subway.
Oh, damn I'm late. Cya all and have a good week.
