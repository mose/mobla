<h2 id="letter-process-and-numbers:83d19966174428ef802df4954f70730e">Letter process and numbers</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s a few weeks now that we are getting organized better, with Xenor and
Tysliu, on the preparation of this newsletter. The guys are now putting more
attention to the news gathering and preformatting the <a href="https://github.com/greenruby/grn-static/blob/master/newsletters/grn.yml">yaml source file</a>
that I use to generate the letter and the website. After
some time of practice, it is much better for me, as now I don&rsquo;t spend 5 hours
each sunday anymore and I can manage the publication process in less than 2
hours. I still gather some extra links after the editors push their
contributions. Then I verify the links, the categories, edit the comments
sometimes, add dots at the ends of line, such tiny things. A huge thanks to
Xenor and Tysliu!</p>

<p>Now we have 1312 subscribers to the newsletter. Plus an unknown number of RSS
subscribers, maybe around 200. We get 250 visits per day on the website
(according to webalizer), and most of them come from rss readers of many
sorts. As the mailchimp is still free until we reach 2000, there is some
margin. When we reach 1600 I think I swill begin a cleaning campaign, to help
people that actually don&rsquo;t read the letter to unsubscribe. I kind of like the
idea of throwing accounts away. Usually in web business, an account is an
asset and they are never thrown away. There is so much to be told about
numbers, and their reality, in our industry.</p>

<p>But the reality about numbers is usually the consequence of the over
simplification required by marketeers. Things are never so simple as just a
single number. The technicians among us are always in pain when we need to
provide numbers, because they come with a strict definition of what they
count, and that definition is never respected by the people that just want to
use the number and put a sexy label on it. When we say &lsquo;registered accounts&rsquo;
they say &lsquo;users&rsquo;. Do you see the difference? Damn, I hate that system that
forces salesmen to become a liars.</p>

<h2 id="rfid-world:662331cbc9868114293fb05e69319f30">RFID world</h2>

<p>They begin to appear everywhere. I saw mine first on my passport, then I just
got my new credit card and it has one in it. Those things are nice if you
consider them naively. But the fact is that they are flawed and insecure. We
carry around more and more of those items that can be read at a proximity by
specially crafter devices. Gosh, did they not learn already from the ingenuity
of our kids?</p>

<p>There have been myths in science fiction about human implanted with chips.
Well, our phones for a while have been providing the same features. Call me
paranoid, but I just don&rsquo;t like the feeling. And I also don&rsquo;t like not having
any choice about it. Hopefully we can still <a href="https://youtu.be/E_f5oRwaQew">disable the credit cards RFID</a>,
<a href="https://youtu.be/BEyRfjeE6ac">craft some pockets</a> to put our passport in
it, or buy some <a href="https://youtu.be/MhW-QLhmoVw">faraday pockets</a>.</p>

<p>If you pay attention, you can find or hear about phone apps called &lsquo;electronic
pickpocket apps&rsquo;. This choice of a name if so relevant to the situation. Note
that NFC, included in more and more phones, is a subcategory of RFID, operates
in much smaller range (10 cm). But basic RFID tags can be detected beyond 100
meters with proper antennas.</p>

<p>We talk about the Internet of Things. Sounds sexy. But clearly, we only are
one of the Things of that Internet. Without any implant, just by carrying
around passport and credit cards. Or by working at a company that uses that
technology for <a href="http://www.wavetrend.net/personnel-tracking.php">staff monitoring</a>. I don&rsquo;t know about you,
but for me, it&rsquo;s scary as hell.</p>

<h2 id="welcome-jessie:d9f4d66fbdcd986833b23a4199ad62c2">Welcome Jessie</h2>

<p>Ok, right. Maybe you don&rsquo;t care, but this saturday <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie">Jessie</a> was
officially released. It&rsquo;s the next stable version of debian, version 8.0, and
it&rsquo;s great that it finally got out. Debian release cycles are certainly not as
fast as Ubuntu, but the stuff in there is more stable. And well, in my
personal case, I work in a place where everything is in debian wheezy and can
now finally get upgraded.</p>

<p>Actually I have been using Ubuntu on my desktop for some time. The reason was
that I wanted to be able to help people to transition to linux, without being
overloaded with support. So I had to know how ubuntu work. But last year I
switched back to the original debian and I have been pretty happy about that.
There is less cruft and opinionated choices (no freaking unity as a default
window manager). And it&rsquo;s pretty straightfoward in the install process. I
suspect even non-techies could give it a try (I know some that did).</p>

<h2 id="state-surveillance-in-france:2e160e3cd77d85bf5cb357e6e45cadd1">State surveillance in France</h2>

<p>What happened this week in France is quite shocking. How can they be so long
to make useful laws and so quick to pass harmful ones? Well the move began in
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/11/french-officials-internet-users-real-time-law">December last year</a>. Some call it a French Patriot act. This
is not the first time there is an attempt from French government to enforce
stronger control on the internet. The pressure of lobbies and media industries
have been pushing hard to preserve their interests.</p>

<p>But this time, it&rsquo;s just about copying the NSA, and get legal requirement for
service providers to host the black boxes. Seems that the Snowden revelations
gave the lawmakers some ideas. The impact is not anecdotal in the French
society. Some service providers announce they will leave the country like
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/11/french-officials-internet-users-real-time-law">Altern</a> (French), others <a href="http://blogs.mediapart.fr/blog/laurent-chemla/170415/lettre-ceux-qui-sen-foutent">call to action</a> (French). Both
Valentin and Laurent are long time activists in the French landscape. I know
them for a while. Funny how things turn out, I&rsquo;m now working in the company
they founded in 99 (and passed hands in 2005).</p>

<p>But all this makes me think that we are facing a technicality. The real thing
is systemic. It seems that we failed, as a civilization, to regain control
over our systems. The course of evolution is going to lead to more control to
the machines, more dependence on the computerized information. Up to a point
where our insignificance as human being will become really obvious.</p>

<p>We, as small makers of this computerized universe, should have some part of
responsibility. Is there a way that we can bend the course of history by the
small choices we make? Can we not take decisions in regard of how to implement
solutions, in a way that we can preserve a margin of freedom and respect for
the human species? I&rsquo;m not sure, at this point, there is anything we can do.
But if we don&rsquo;t try, we will never know. Think about it. You build systems.
You shape the world. Your choice matters.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-inheritance-simulation:a9a546e37849f6a570839940ccf98c98">Multiple inheritance simulation</h2>

<p>This is a bit twisted. In ruby, as you know, you cannot use multiple
inheritance. But the flexibility of the language, especially the
metaprogramming aspect, opens the door for some cheating. Check out
<a href="https://gist.github.com/capitalist/473543b7ea24d461d030">this code</a>, it tricks it by declaring the first class as the super
class and the remaining classes as modules included in that super class.
Pretty acrobatic and elegant, imho.</p>

<h2 id="about-vaping:a9a546e37849f6a570839940ccf98c98">About vaping</h2>

<p>Well this has been my burden for 30 years, and I&rsquo;m not proud of it. But last
week it finally ended. I quit smoking. But this was kindof a trick, as it was
made possible by switching to <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5-facts-that-everyone-gets-wrong-about-vaping-1659938937">vaping</a>. It certainly doesn&rsquo;t solve the
nicotine addiction issue, but I&rsquo;m very happy with this move and hopeful for a
gradual freedom.</p>

<p>I also found out that this vaping practice is very geeky. The hardware part is
quite elaborate, vaping devices are really neat piece of work, there are a
bunch of vendors. The liquidware is also quite a subject of hacking.
Technically it&rsquo;s not that hard to do it yourself. Not surprising that I
discovered this vaping practice in geeks circles.</p>

<p>We had this week a very productive meeting with xenor and tysliu in our
preferred coffee shop. I explained more in detail my workflow and my quality
criterias. So now they can feed the links section and become the major editors
of Green Ruby. I Still keep the role of the publisher. I get their links, I
clean up stuff, verify freshness and reachability, remove superlatives, fix
category if needed.</p>

<p>Special thanks a lot to Xenor and Tysliu (aka. Simon). Now they do the heavy
lifting and they are the reason why Green Ruby is still in your mailbox every
week.</p>

<h2 id="drones-and-makers:84bb7b31097e7dff868fbef479daafb5">Drones and makers</h2>

<p>This is now obvious. We are going to get invaded by drones. Of course we will
pretend we control them, for a while. But I can bet it&rsquo;s not going to stand
too long. Their autonomy is a competitive factor, and, in our current society,
competitive is the Darwinian selective factor. It can be a bit scary.</p>

<p>But on another hand, when we geeks look at those things with our (never-aging)
kids eyes, we see fun toys. Look at the <a href="http://www.bgobeyond.co.uk/">B Flying car</a>. We can
<a href="http://diydrones.com/">do them ourselves</a>. Like we were able to tinker with the first computers, the
first radio stations. But now we have 3D printing. Yet not that affordable,
but it seems to get better. There is also that creepy <a href="http://the3doodler.com/">3Doodler</a>
thingie, and various other new techniques.</p>

<p>Maybe the Makers movement is the hope for humanity. Reclaim the daily small
things! Check that <a href="http://www.instructables.com/">instructable</a> website it&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Well yeah this all has nothing to do with webdev. Except from the fact that
open standards made possible to people like me to do the web myself. After a
time, it became a professional activity. Will we get professional makers in
the future and see a revival of craftsmanship? I really wonder.</p>

<h2 id="time-to-upgrade:d4567cfa55308712270d1f5b73098130">Time to upgrade</h2>

<p>This is a long time I plan to re-engineer the way Green Ruby is produced. Last
week I told Xenor and Simon I was thinking about giving it a break. I&rsquo;m not
that much anymore in the flow. Now my days are full ops and not that much dev.
But the guys didn&rsquo;t want to let me stop.</p>

<p>So we are going to organize things a little differently. Xenor and Simon,
which are full time rails developers, are going to handle the content more
extensively, and I will just manage the publication, plus some devops links.
So we need to get some tools ready to handle that new flow. Maybe, the time it
gets ready, we will take some time off. Maybe not.</p>

<p>What I wish is to have a way to let more people jump in, too. Maybe we will
get inspiration in how <a href="http://thechangelog.com/trello-as-a-cms/">the changelog</a> manages their news
flow. They based it on a <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> and it&rsquo;s quite clever. By chance I
explored the trello API recently and I can tell it&rsquo;s really good, very
suitable for custom automation.</p>

<p>This week, I will play lazy on the podcasts. I don&rsquo;t think they are that much
interesting anyways, and all that copy-pasting is exhausting. When some
podcasts stands out of the crowd, I will rather feature it in this rant.</p>

<h2 id="about-blogging:111d43eaf8a2a6adad496f0417e7f52c">About blogging</h2>

<p>Well, since that whole blogging thing began, I never have been very active on
it. Well, I have a <a href="http://blog.mose.com">blog</a> on Tumblr because I wanted to know how they
are doing it, I published various posts in the <a href="http://devtips.faria.co/authors.html#mose-ref">faria devtips</a>, and
after all, this rant could also count as a publication. So I think I will
gather them all under one unique site. A Jekyll github-pages kind, easy and
cheap.</p>

<p>After all, I&rsquo;m not sure the devtips website will stay up any longer. There
have been no post since the day I left. Too bad. It&rsquo;s a demonstration that
some collective actions can sometimes rely only on the energy of one person.</p>

<p>So, I made a <a href="http://mose.github.io/blog">new repo</a> on github for it, and I will gather whatever
stuff I can find that I wrote in there.</p>

<h2 id="lovely-freebsd:111d43eaf8a2a6adad496f0417e7f52c">Lovely FreeBSD</h2>

<p>At our Gandi office in Taipei I had to install a <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/">pfsense</a> server,
which is based on <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>. It was quite a pleasant experience,
actually. Last time I played a bit with BSD that was 12 years ago, and that
was not very smooth. I&rsquo;m happy to be given that occasion to see how it goes
now.</p>

<p>For now I&rsquo;m going to use it like if it was an <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a> with some
extra <a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source.html">OpenVPN</a> abilities. And it will also be a file server for the
LAN. Not sure yet how I will handle that.</p>

<h2 id="ruby-package-management:111d43eaf8a2a6adad496f0417e7f52c">Ruby package management</h2>

<p>When I got in my new job, I discovered a new way to manage server management.
They didn&rsquo;t want to use <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a>, or even <a href="https://rubygems.org/">ruby gems</a>, or
<a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/">pip</a> or anything that is not debian packages. It may sound quite harsh.
Since I came in ruby in 2010, rvm has been my best friend, bundle the second
one. But this approach is very developer-based. When you maintain large and
stable systems, it&rsquo;s more likely that you will not trust the bleeding edge
stuff and prefer confirmed publication of packages before using them. This is
an interesting slap on my face.</p>

<p>Of course there are the <a href="https://www.brightbox.com/docs/ruby/ubuntu/">brightbox</a> packages for Ubuntu, but that&rsquo;s
missing the point. A release has to be out for a certain time so it can be
strengthened by security reviews and proper production usage. There is a part
of the population for each language that is considering the instability of
current releases a normal trade-off. but there is a huge lot of other
companies that will wait patiently that things get stable enough for their
taste.</p>

<h2 id="working-abroad:a0091e7eb1dfeca477447c7e0b2e6425">Working abroad</h2>

<p>Our craft as webdev is clearly in huge demand. This provides an opportunity
for us to travel abroad, discover new cultures, widen our horizon. When I went
to live in Taiwan, I was not worried about finding a job. But when hunting for
a job abroad it can be tricky to find companies that will sponsor a visa, a
work permit, or whatever legal requirement is involved in each countries.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what the new initiative called <a href="http://techmeabroad.com">TechMeAbroad</a> aims to fix, by
listing only job opportunities for which a work permit is sponsored. As
<a href="http://jbarbier42.tumblr.com/post/112155851079/introducing-techmeabroad">Julien Barbier explains</a>, it will launch in march, and if you know of any
job offers that includes a visa or such thing, please let him know (or send it
to me I will pass it along), so we can feed that platform with some real data
quickly.</p>

<h2 id="so-long-ruby-1-9:a0091e7eb1dfeca477447c7e0b2e6425">So long ruby 1.9</h2>

<p>As planned, it&rsquo;s now time to say <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2015/02/23/support-for-ruby-1-9-3-has-ended/">byebye to ruby 1.9.3</a>. But there is still
so many old version of ruby in the wild. In debian squeeze, you gotta use 1.8.
In wheezy, you have 1.9. And there are still many servers that will refuse to
upgrade.</p>

<h2 id="pick-your-hero:a0091e7eb1dfeca477447c7e0b2e6425">Pick your hero</h2>

<p>The registration for <a href="http://rubyheroes.com/">Ruby Heroes 2015</a> is now open. Go vote for your
favorite ruby influential dev. You have until <a href="http://railsconf.com/">railsconf</a> that will happen
in april, in Atlanta this year.</p>
