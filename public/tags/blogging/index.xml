&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-back-into-writing:de01faa72149d30f4eb88db96f78a8dd&#34;&gt;Getting back into writing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I got tired of leading &lt;a href=&#34;http://greenruby.org&#34;&gt;Greenruby&lt;/a&gt;
publication and Xenor accepted to jump in and take the publisher role.
I&amp;rsquo;m very grateful about it. But as a secundary effect, I lost that ranting
channel I got used to abuse. Each week, I was getting somehow acustomed
to send some rant with the list of links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to get back into a publisher mood. I have various thoughts
that could deserve sharing, or at least, publication. Well I don&amp;rsquo;t tweet much
and I hate facebook, so my media coverage may be a little tiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s not really a problem. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I have some agenda.
I just wish to exercise my right to reflect aloud on various topics, bring to
the open some personal and/or original thoughts. Nothing more. Whoever reads,
do it in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
