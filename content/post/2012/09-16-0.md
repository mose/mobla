I was used to checkout the new gems on twitter while in public transportation, but the flow stopped 2 weeks ago. So after a while I just wrote my own webhook, that was amazingly easy and just took 2 hours (well it’s not elaborated and test-backed and all but it works)

<https://github.com/mose/rubygems-alt>

Now I can follow the feed again on <https://twitter.com/RubyGemsAlt> and even better, I can change the formatting of it haha.

I think next move would be to automatically add hashtags on the description from a list of known ones, like #rails or #sinatra. And I also need to daemonize it, right now it’s just running in a screen but daemonizing it would not be hard at all (with daemon gem).

But you are welcome to fork me and pull request and everything.
