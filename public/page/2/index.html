<h2 id="a-taste-of-freebsd:2e9f17a4684b1292d2dd8dbb76b48337">a taste of FreeBSD</h2>

<p>This weekend I installed <a href="http://freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a> 10.1 on a disk of my desktop.
Beyond the fact that we are using that system at work, more and more, I was
just curious about the setup for a desktop. I was pleasantly surprised and
everything went very smoothly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m quite familiar with Linux and that was enough for making the ride very
easy. The general impression is that actually the system is simpler than on
Linux, maybe more consistent. The pkg system, alternative to the traditional
ports system, makes thing much more &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo;.</p>

<p>And for the rest, well, in one afternoon, and just by following the doc, I had
my window manager up and running, and ready to begin playing with
<a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/bhyve">bhyve</a>. I was surprised to see that bhyve kernel modules were included
by default in recent releases. I heard there are still some bumps on the road
for laptop about the sleep to disk mode, but I&rsquo;m not concerned by that.</p>

<p>It feels like BSD is a shy actor that actually powers much more stuff that we
can suspect. But it has a pretty active community and a very decent
documentation. Well, give it a try if you like playing with various
distributions of free and open operating systems. It&rsquo;s much less scary that
its reputation seems to convey.</p>

<h2 id="the-yin-and-yang-of-software-development:aff213456bcfa77c48418a9edd40a18a">The yin and yang of software development</h2>

<p>The topic I talked about last week led me to think about it more widely. And I
ended up with the thinking that many problems in software companies are a
clear problem of balance between their yin and their yang.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang">old chinese principle</a> is documented in a very old-fashioned
way, opposing genders and principles. But actually it sums up in the fact that
many dynamics are to be based in a balance between two opposing principles.
Otherwise they fail.</p>

<p>The way I see it, software developers are a nurturing kind. This profile has
to consider long term. It decides actions for later outcomes. It&rsquo;s about
giving life and growing it. It feels closer to the Yin principle.</p>

<p>On another hand, the business people are bound to a shorter time frame. And I
don&rsquo;t talk about the entrepreneurs and the rare visionary people, but the real
business work force. They are competitive, aggressive, fighters. That really
feels to me like the Yang concept.</p>

<p>And all occurrences where I saw software companies failing, I think it was
because there was a lack of balance between those 2 principles. Either the
management was too soft and not aggressive enough towards its market, either
it was too aggressive and nurturing was not considered enough in their
equation.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that this balance requirement applies to everything, to be
honest. But in a constituted body of a software organization, considering the
current (questionable) market economy, it feels that the Yin and the Yang have
to be in balance to grant a chance of survival to the organization.</p>

<p>One may have the feeling that the dominant Yang (business side) is the more
common case. But they are just more noisy. Many projects stay silently in the
darkness just because there was no real business consideration (or even
refusal of it).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://modeling-languages.com/grady-booch-on-the-future-of-software-engineering-video-and-highlights/">keynote of Grady Booch</a> (linked in the video section) confirmed
me in various ways in this opinion. Engineers have the duty to fight for the
balance when they can. They have to understand that it&rsquo;s not a one-way deal,
as well. If you want to exercise programming in a nurturing-only context, win
a lottery and dedicate your time writing free software (where market
requirements don&rsquo;t apply). But in the usual case, you may have to consider if
you are in a balanced context, and if not, try to work on balancing it.</p>

<h2 id="a-word-about-project-gardening:3f19ca908c642cafd8c3253d0dfb2a28">A word about project gardening</h2>

<p>In the last 2 companies where I worked, there was this recurring issue.
Actually I noticed it for a while but for some reasons it became more obvious
to me with time passing. The project management role is usually badly
fulfilled.</p>

<p>But at some point, and even from the point of view of a developer, there is in
projects the need for a dedicated person for doing some gardening. Yeah it&rsquo;s
all about daily ungrateful clearing the bad weeds, making sure the soil is
rich enough, and that the seeds are all planted where they should be planted,
that soil pH is adequate for this or that variety. Having someone that is just
doing moderation on projects also frees the productive people from lengthly
and sometimes non technical meetings. It is the occasion to have someone that
keeps track of specs, sometimes gather them or (re)write them down in a
central place.</p>

<p>The problem in the transition from waterfall to agile, is that in the
waterfall model there is a hierarchic feeling in the role of the project
manager. The Management word into it is misleading. It leads the developers to
frown upon it. I have the impression that in agile teams, project management
is supposed to be taken care of organically by the dev teams, sometimes by the
scrum master or whatever facilitator is there for enforcing the agile process.
Or the product owner will be technical enough to fill up that role. More or
less.</p>

<p>But the reality is that project grooming is a full time job that may have to
be re-invented. It certainly should take in account developers creativity and
pertinence in the match of the objectives with the technical realities. But
it&rsquo;s necessary to have a person that is the reference on keeping track of the
need and follow the quality process at all the stages. Well, at least when you
begin to get many developers and many projects, and developers that work on
many projects.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s a question of scale. Companies with less than 30 people may never
face that need because there is a natural fluidity internally and not that
many projects. But when you get to 100 and you still don&rsquo;t have people
dedicated to projects, then you can see developers burning out. Projects
become lousy because nobody has time to write specs. You also can see
emergence of hero coders that can by miracle make it all happen. But you will
postpone the problem because heroes are not scalable and can even be toxic on
the long run (as any experienced practitioner already knows).</p>

<p>Personally in my technical career I never liked the project managers that I
met. But that is a long time I didn&rsquo;t meet any. It dates from an age where
agile was not there yet. But now that I don&rsquo;t see them anymore, I feel that
something is missing. It certainly exists in various places. And I can bet
that many of them are as bad as they were in the last century. But maybe there
is a new species of project curators out there that I didn&rsquo;t meet yet. I read
about those in various places, but in my (small) world, this is still a
mythical beast.</p>

<h2 id="thought-about-python-fron-a-rubyist:cdf97fab83b684f4dce127ec09f067df">Thought about python fron a rubyist</h2>

<p>This weekend there was a python conference here in Taipei (<a href="https://tw.pycon.org/2015apac/en/">pycon apac</a>).
As Gandi was sponsoring it, I <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/43946968@N07/sets/72157653640049980">went there</a> and tried to
figure out how python and ruby communities differ in my local area. As a
matter of fact, I also push my python coding skills a bit. I kind of like to
nurture a general polyglot approach.</p>

<p>It first seems that the python community is more largely supported by sponsors
than ruby one. It&rsquo;s more mainstream in the general engineering world, I guess.
There was google, facebook, microsoft, having a table and talking about their
cloud things. But the general setup was pretty similar to the ruby or rails
conf I&rsquo;ve been in.</p>

<p>The topics in this conference were maybe a little more scientific and less
web-oriented than we can find in ruby world. Python has tighter bindings with
lower level languages. I think it&rsquo;s not a specificity of the language because
you also can build C extensions for ruby. But it&rsquo;s more a result of the
community interests.</p>

<p>I have the feeling that the ruby community dedicated more efforts towards the
web front and other rails related principle like testing suites, DSL and
meta-programming. But my general feeling is that there is no technical reason
for that. It&rsquo;s just how things happened over time, mostly given the weight of
rails in the ruby communities.</p>

<p>Actually, I also had the feeling that pythonists don&rsquo;t consider ruby as a
&lsquo;competitor&rsquo;. They feel closer to java, node or golang, and at various
occasion I had the impression that they consider ruby to be only the language
behind rails.</p>

<p>I also thought that the ruby community was special about its adoption of
macbook laptops. Even if actually the python coder has more diversity, I
evaluate around half macbooks, the rest split between ubuntu and windows. It&rsquo;s
less that in ruby confs where macbooks are kinda 90% and windows users are
very few.</p>

<p>Also, I noticed a similar movement about diversity with <a href="http://djangogirls.org/taipei/">django girls</a>
and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesTW/">pyladies</a>, comparable to the rails girls,
which tries to close the gender gap in the engineering world.</p>

<p>Anyways that was good and interesting. Geeks are the same kind, whatever
language they use (by trade or by taste). I strongly advise, if you have the
occasion, to wander out of your usual communities and join other circles. It
gives a good perspective on you usual world.</p>

<h2 id="linux-trick-too-many-logs:195c338923f21c367264a5b5fb00e8a9">linux trick: too many logs</h2>

<p>Recently I found my self again in that situation on a linux server. The
partition where logs are stored went 100%. In such case, It&rsquo;s clever top purge
old useless logfiles. Typical move for me would be to run logrotate manually
with</p>

<p>logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf</p>

<p>But I had a case where that was not enough. A developer forgot to remove a
debugging output and the logs were just gathering way too much information,
more than what I could free with some janitoring.</p>

<p>To avoid losing logs, we can move the logfile where there is space and replace
the file with a symbolic link. That&rsquo;s good enough for until the partition gets
resized of the logs get cleaned. But when it&rsquo;s done on a live logfile, the
running process that writes into it still has the same file descriptor. The
process has to be relaunched so the new fd can be taken in account, on the new
partition, as instructed by the symbolic link.</p>

<p>So a colleague pointed out that could be done without restart by using gdb.
It&rsquo;s a pretty neat trick (if you have gdb installed on your production server,
which may not always be the case, and for good reasons). Anyways I had it at
hand, and here is the sequence:</p>

<p>touch /path/to/new/logfile</p>

<p>gdb -p pid</p>

<p>(gdb) call dup(1)
  $1 = 3
  (gdb) call close(1)
  $2 = 0
  (gdb) call open(&ldquo;/path/to/new/logfile&rdquo;, 2)
  $3 = 1
  (gdb) call close($1)
  $4 = 0
  (gdb)</p>

<p>This gave me the taste of digging up a little bit more on how gdb can interact
with live processes.</p>

<h2 id="the-side-effects-of-recruitment:849328e7dfc904a2b6d861e0036f0df4">The side effects of recruitment</h2>

<p>Recently I had to look for a new devops for our team. I have been handling
technical recruitment at many occasions, and each time I have to explain my
colleagues that I have a special process. The fact is, the technical sphere is
a small one, we are all linked, more or less, to a community. Well, in my
case, I always have had to recruit people in companies that were hiring the
kind of people that commit on github, have some kind of community activity, at
least. I guess that in huge companies where people are just a set of
checkboxes, things go a bit differently.</p>

<p>But anyways, in my case, and probably in the case of all recruiters in modern
and small businesses, it&rsquo;s not all about checkboxes and profiles. It&rsquo;s about
personality, compatibility, and mindset. So when I first get a contact with a
candidate, I invite him (or much more rarely, her), to a chat online,
preferably on irc or whatever real-time discussion media is more fit (for a
linux geek, if you can&rsquo;t go on irc, then there is a problem).</p>

<p>I noticed that during my past sessions of recruitment, I established contacts
with very interesting people. By having an unformal discussion online, just
chit-chating of what work we do and what we did before, it&rsquo;s kind of easy to
get an idea of what is the kind of relationship you will have with your
potential future colleague. But beyond that, it&rsquo;s all about making things
personal. We are all unique. It cannot be computed, scripted, engineered in a
way that non-technical people would be successful conducting that process. It
takes a geek to recognize another geek.</p>

<p>At Gandi of course we have a HR person. But she usually appears at the very
end of the process and not at the beginning. The peers are going to evaluate
candidates, make their mind to see if they want to spend days and days
collaborating with them. It matches with my way to do things, fortunately. If
I have any doubt of the technical abilities on someone, I don&rsquo;t do stupid
technical tests, I try to find other people that know the candidate and get
third party feedback. If not, then I try to use a meetup in a community
related to the speciality in question, so we can discuss and be around other
people where some tangent discussion can happen.</p>

<p>At the end, if all goes well, then the candidate is going to enter the more
formal whatever the company uses as a recruitment flow. But that&rsquo;s merely a
formality. And after 20 years building up teams and recruiting people, I can
affirm that instinct always wins, in my case. If I smell anything fishy in an
unformal context, there is going to be problems. Well, the process is never
perfect, it also can smell ok but stink after 3 months, too.</p>

<p>But the thing is that having those chats online with peers is pretty
interesting. I learn a lot about how other companies work, how they handle
their management, what kind of work conditions they have. Just because it&rsquo;s
part of the contact process. So I&rsquo;m not really in hurry to make a final
decision because, to be honest, I just enjoy those contacts.</p>

<p>It certainly takes some time, I can&rsquo;t be in constant recruitment, but from
time to time, it&rsquo;s very valuable. And not only for the effect of recruiting
someone. It creates bonds with the industry, with people, with communities.</p>

<h2 id="noobs-rule-the-planet:fb906e6159a53dc43f4de9d255805b75">Noobs rule the planet</h2>

<p>There is something that I always did in my career managing internet tools. I
volunteer helping non-technical people to get a presence online, build up
communities and such things. But I have to confess, this comes with a price. A
price on your nerves when you realize that easy obvious things that you take
for granted are actually not clear at all by the average Joe.</p>

<p>Yeah sure they can post of facebook. For many of them, it&rsquo;s pretty much all
what internet means. But for the real things, they have no clue what they are
doing. Talk about the merits of a chaos money to test your infrastructure.
Well, the man on the street is pretty much the best you can get when it comes
to chaos testing your design and workflow.</p>

<p>But whatever infuriating it can be, it&rsquo;s a great thing to keep in mind. People
have no clue what they are doing. They don&rsquo;t know what an url is. They think
smileys are fun. They feel writing all in capitals is just a detail. When some
popup appears they consider it&rsquo;s all broken and there is no need to read
what&rsquo;s written on it because anyways that&rsquo;s over their heads.</p>

<p>So, when you design your applications, you may be lucky enough to face an
educated population. But in many cases, you may not. Take it in account. Make
things over-explicit and use images to bypass the inability of the modern
average people to read anything that is more than a sentence of 5 words.</p>

<p>Go volunteer to help your fellow neighbors in your local non-tech communities.
It&rsquo;s hard, but it helps keep in touch with the reality.</p>

<p>And above all, keep patience. It&rsquo;s not their fault. There has never been any
economical incentive to educate users. The shortest path is always the best
path. So for sure, you should make things easy. But if you get any occasion to
provide your users some education, it&rsquo;s never going to be on your spec sheets.
You can do it as a natural thing to do. Add optional text to explain why
things are the way they are. Few will read it, but they will learn from it.</p>

<h2 id="letter-process-and-numbers:83d19966174428ef802df4954f70730e">Letter process and numbers</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s a few weeks now that we are getting organized better, with Xenor and
Tysliu, on the preparation of this newsletter. The guys are now putting more
attention to the news gathering and preformatting the <a href="https://github.com/greenruby/grn-static/blob/master/newsletters/grn.yml">yaml source file</a>
that I use to generate the letter and the website. After
some time of practice, it is much better for me, as now I don&rsquo;t spend 5 hours
each sunday anymore and I can manage the publication process in less than 2
hours. I still gather some extra links after the editors push their
contributions. Then I verify the links, the categories, edit the comments
sometimes, add dots at the ends of line, such tiny things. A huge thanks to
Xenor and Tysliu!</p>

<p>Now we have 1312 subscribers to the newsletter. Plus an unknown number of RSS
subscribers, maybe around 200. We get 250 visits per day on the website
(according to webalizer), and most of them come from rss readers of many
sorts. As the mailchimp is still free until we reach 2000, there is some
margin. When we reach 1600 I think I swill begin a cleaning campaign, to help
people that actually don&rsquo;t read the letter to unsubscribe. I kind of like the
idea of throwing accounts away. Usually in web business, an account is an
asset and they are never thrown away. There is so much to be told about
numbers, and their reality, in our industry.</p>

<p>But the reality about numbers is usually the consequence of the over
simplification required by marketeers. Things are never so simple as just a
single number. The technicians among us are always in pain when we need to
provide numbers, because they come with a strict definition of what they
count, and that definition is never respected by the people that just want to
use the number and put a sexy label on it. When we say &lsquo;registered accounts&rsquo;
they say &lsquo;users&rsquo;. Do you see the difference? Damn, I hate that system that
forces salesmen to become a liars.</p>

<h2 id="rfid-world:662331cbc9868114293fb05e69319f30">RFID world</h2>

<p>They begin to appear everywhere. I saw mine first on my passport, then I just
got my new credit card and it has one in it. Those things are nice if you
consider them naively. But the fact is that they are flawed and insecure. We
carry around more and more of those items that can be read at a proximity by
specially crafter devices. Gosh, did they not learn already from the ingenuity
of our kids?</p>

<p>There have been myths in science fiction about human implanted with chips.
Well, our phones for a while have been providing the same features. Call me
paranoid, but I just don&rsquo;t like the feeling. And I also don&rsquo;t like not having
any choice about it. Hopefully we can still <a href="https://youtu.be/E_f5oRwaQew">disable the credit cards RFID</a>,
<a href="https://youtu.be/BEyRfjeE6ac">craft some pockets</a> to put our passport in
it, or buy some <a href="https://youtu.be/MhW-QLhmoVw">faraday pockets</a>.</p>

<p>If you pay attention, you can find or hear about phone apps called &lsquo;electronic
pickpocket apps&rsquo;. This choice of a name if so relevant to the situation. Note
that NFC, included in more and more phones, is a subcategory of RFID, operates
in much smaller range (10 cm). But basic RFID tags can be detected beyond 100
meters with proper antennas.</p>

<p>We talk about the Internet of Things. Sounds sexy. But clearly, we only are
one of the Things of that Internet. Without any implant, just by carrying
around passport and credit cards. Or by working at a company that uses that
technology for <a href="http://www.wavetrend.net/personnel-tracking.php">staff monitoring</a>. I don&rsquo;t know about you,
but for me, it&rsquo;s scary as hell.</p>

<h2 id="welcome-jessie:d9f4d66fbdcd986833b23a4199ad62c2">Welcome Jessie</h2>

<p>Ok, right. Maybe you don&rsquo;t care, but this saturday <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie">Jessie</a> was
officially released. It&rsquo;s the next stable version of debian, version 8.0, and
it&rsquo;s great that it finally got out. Debian release cycles are certainly not as
fast as Ubuntu, but the stuff in there is more stable. And well, in my
personal case, I work in a place where everything is in debian wheezy and can
now finally get upgraded.</p>

<p>Actually I have been using Ubuntu on my desktop for some time. The reason was
that I wanted to be able to help people to transition to linux, without being
overloaded with support. So I had to know how ubuntu work. But last year I
switched back to the original debian and I have been pretty happy about that.
There is less cruft and opinionated choices (no freaking unity as a default
window manager). And it&rsquo;s pretty straightfoward in the install process. I
suspect even non-techies could give it a try (I know some that did).</p>
