Some time ago, when I left Faria, I bought a laptop with a clear purpose. I
wanted to have on linux the same screen experience that I had with the macbook
pro connected to 2 thunderbolts. So I got an [asus UX301L][1] plus 2 
[Dell screens U2713HM][2] who supports a 2560x1440 resolution. The laptop in itself
is amazing, dazzling fast, and all worked well with an ubuntu install. This
was not cheap but that was a while I didn't spend anything on hardware.

I struggled a bit to find the proper connectors so I could enable the extra
large resolution on connected screens. I ended up using the mini-hdmi
connector plus a mini-display port converter to DVI for the second one. And
finally it worked last week. I had to [force the resolution in xrandr][3] and
now I have a damn huge double display for a total of 7680x1440. What a blast!

## Debian, i3wm and urxvt

Well this is an old story. Some time ago I switched from debian + fvwm2/ion to
ubuntu + cinnamon just because I had to know about it. The goal was to be able
to convince my wife (and some other non-techies) to switch to ubuntu. But I
had to know how it worked on a daily basis. And it was a success for most of
it.

2 years ago at Faria I was given a mac. Well, it was good to know a bit more
about it, my mac knowledge was dating from system 6.7 time. But if the
hardware is really good, the OSX experience didn't really satisfy the geek
that was deep inside me.

Then I got back into a team that is deeply attached to pure linux traditions,
when I joined Gandi. I now switched back to a debian jessie with [i3wm][7] on
my work laptop. Wow this feels good to be back to such a rude but flexible
environment. As a matter of fact all went perfectly well and all the tricks I
knew 10 years ago are still very valid.

I also took that occasion to get back into urxvt, for my terminal emulator.
It's a very badly documented over-powerful tool. But when you get the grasp on
it, possibilities are much more satisfying than with gnome-terminal. I'm still
working on [my configuration][4] to match few features that gnome terminal had
(like font resizing, clipboard management). The [notification plugin][5],
combined with [dunst][6], gives amazing results.

It feels good to be back into the cave. To mark this change, I didn't shave
for 3 months so now I'm really bearded like the old-fashioned linux bears.
Muhaha!

PS: no worry, I'm still fullstack at heart and I still love ruby!
