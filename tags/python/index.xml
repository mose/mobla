&lt;h2 id=&#34;thought-about-python-fron-a-rubyist:cdf97fab83b684f4dce127ec09f067df&#34;&gt;Thought about python fron a rubyist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend there was a python conference here in Taipei (&lt;a href=&#34;https://tw.pycon.org/2015apac/en/&#34;&gt;pycon apac&lt;/a&gt;).
As Gandi was sponsoring it, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/43946968@N07/sets/72157653640049980&#34;&gt;went there&lt;/a&gt; and tried to
figure out how python and ruby communities differ in my local area. As a
matter of fact, I also push my python coding skills a bit. I kind of like to
nurture a general polyglot approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It first seems that the python community is more largely supported by sponsors
than ruby one. It&amp;rsquo;s more mainstream in the general engineering world, I guess.
There was google, facebook, microsoft, having a table and talking about their
cloud things. But the general setup was pretty similar to the ruby or rails
conf I&amp;rsquo;ve been in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topics in this conference were maybe a little more scientific and less
web-oriented than we can find in ruby world. Python has tighter bindings with
lower level languages. I think it&amp;rsquo;s not a specificity of the language because
you also can build C extensions for ruby. But it&amp;rsquo;s more a result of the
community interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the feeling that the ruby community dedicated more efforts towards the
web front and other rails related principle like testing suites, DSL and
meta-programming. But my general feeling is that there is no technical reason
for that. It&amp;rsquo;s just how things happened over time, mostly given the weight of
rails in the ruby communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I also had the feeling that pythonists don&amp;rsquo;t consider ruby as a
&amp;lsquo;competitor&amp;rsquo;. They feel closer to java, node or golang, and at various
occasion I had the impression that they consider ruby to be only the language
behind rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also thought that the ruby community was special about its adoption of
macbook laptops. Even if actually the python coder has more diversity, I
evaluate around half macbooks, the rest split between ubuntu and windows. It&amp;rsquo;s
less that in ruby confs where macbooks are kinda 90% and windows users are
very few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I noticed a similar movement about diversity with &lt;a href=&#34;http://djangogirls.org/taipei/&#34;&gt;django girls&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesTW/&#34;&gt;pyladies&lt;/a&gt;, comparable to the rails girls,
which tries to close the gender gap in the engineering world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways that was good and interesting. Geeks are the same kind, whatever
language they use (by trade or by taste). I strongly advise, if you have the
occasion, to wander out of your usual communities and join other circles. It
gives a good perspective on you usual world.&lt;/p&gt;
