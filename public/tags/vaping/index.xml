&lt;h2 id=&#34;multiple-inheritance-simulation:a9a546e37849f6a570839940ccf98c98&#34;&gt;Multiple inheritance simulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a bit twisted. In ruby, as you know, you cannot use multiple
inheritance. But the flexibility of the language, especially the
metaprogramming aspect, opens the door for some cheating. Check out
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/capitalist/473543b7ea24d461d030&#34;&gt;this code&lt;/a&gt;, it tricks it by declaring the first class as the super
class and the remaining classes as modules included in that super class.
Pretty acrobatic and elegant, imho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-vaping:a9a546e37849f6a570839940ccf98c98&#34;&gt;About vaping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well this has been my burden for 30 years, and I&amp;rsquo;m not proud of it. But last
week it finally ended. I quit smoking. But this was kindof a trick, as it was
made possible by switching to &lt;a href=&#34;http://gizmodo.com/5-facts-that-everyone-gets-wrong-about-vaping-1659938937&#34;&gt;vaping&lt;/a&gt;. It certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve the
nicotine addiction issue, but I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with this move and hopeful for a
gradual freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found out that this vaping practice is very geeky. The hardware part is
quite elaborate, vaping devices are really neat piece of work, there are a
bunch of vendors. The liquidware is also quite a subject of hacking.
Technically it&amp;rsquo;s not that hard to do it yourself. Not surprising that I
discovered this vaping practice in geeks circles.&lt;/p&gt;
