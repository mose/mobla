<h2 id="more-screens:d021634982f7dcb44b802e2a3d2040a7">More Screens</h2>

<p>Some time ago, when I left Faria, I bought a laptop with a clear purpose. I
wanted to have on linux the same screen experience that I had with the macbook
pro connected to 2 thunderbolts. So I got an <a href="http://www.asus.com/us/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/ASUS_ZENBOOK_UX301LA/">asus UX301L</a> plus 2
<a href="http://accessories.ap.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=au&amp;cs=audhs1&amp;l=en&amp;redirect=1&amp;s=dhs&amp;sku=210-40773">Dell screens U2713HM</a> who supports a 2560x1440 resolution. The laptop in itself
is amazing, dazzling fast, and all worked well with an ubuntu install. This
was not cheap but that was a while I didn&rsquo;t spend anything on hardware.</p>

<p>I struggled a bit to find the proper connectors so I could enable the extra
large resolution on connected screens. I ended up using the mini-hdmi
connector plus a mini-display port converter to DVI for the second one. And
finally it worked last week. I had to <a href="http://www.arunviswanathan.com/node/53">force the resolution in xrandr</a> and
now I have a damn huge double display for a total of 7680x1440. What a blast!</p>

<h2 id="debian-i3wm-and-urxvt:d021634982f7dcb44b802e2a3d2040a7">Debian, i3wm and urxvt</h2>

<p>Well this is an old story. Some time ago I switched from debian + fvwm2/ion to
ubuntu + cinnamon just because I had to know about it. The goal was to be able
to convince my wife (and some other non-techies) to switch to ubuntu. But I
had to know how it worked on a daily basis. And it was a success for most of
it.</p>

<p>2 years ago at Faria I was given a mac. Well, it was good to know a bit more
about it, my mac knowledge was dating from system 6.7 time. But if the
hardware is really good, the OSX experience didn&rsquo;t really satisfy the geek
that was deep inside me.</p>

<p>Then I got back into a team that is deeply attached to pure linux traditions,
when I joined Gandi. I now switched back to a debian jessie with <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3wm</a> on
my work laptop. Wow this feels good to be back to such a rude but flexible
environment. As a matter of fact all went perfectly well and all the tricks I
knew 10 years ago are still very valid.</p>

<p>I also took that occasion to get back into urxvt, for my terminal emulator.
It&rsquo;s a very badly documented over-powerful tool. But when you get the grasp on
it, possibilities are much more satisfying than with gnome-terminal. I&rsquo;m still
working on <a href="https://github.com/mose/rcfiles/blob/master/.Xdefaults">my configuration</a> to match few features that gnome terminal had
(like font resizing, clipboard management). The <a href="https://github.com/mose/rcfiles/blob/master/.urxvt/ext/notification">notification plugin</a>,
combined with <a href="http://knopwob.org/dunst/index.html">dunst</a>, gives amazing results.</p>

<p>It feels good to be back into the cave. To mark this change, I didn&rsquo;t shave
for 3 months so now I&rsquo;m really bearded like the old-fashioned linux bears.
Muhaha!</p>

<p>PS: no worry, I&rsquo;m still fullstack at heart and I still love ruby!</p>

<h2 id="while42:7b1eab39a4e6e397eafd98271e67cb67">While42</h2>

<p>This week I got in contact with Sylvain from <a href="http://while42.org">while42</a>. It&rsquo;s a social
network for french tech engineers, but with a special touch on it. There is no
facebook page or google group. They intentionally decided to be irl-first. For
people that are most likely to be online all the time, this sounds so
therapeutic! So, I decided, with Thomas from Gandi, to setup a Taiwan chapter.
If you want to know more (and are french, engineer, and living in Taipei) just
drop me a mail.</p>

<h2 id="traveling-ruby:7b1eab39a4e6e397eafd98271e67cb67">Traveling ruby</h2>

<p>This is a project from the <a href="http://www.phusion.nl/">Phusion</a> people, called <a href="https://github.com/phusion/traveling-ruby">Traveling ruby</a>.
Its purpose is to make it easy to build auto-sustaining tarballs for ruby
programms, including ruby binary and all gems in it. That way you can publish
a tarball and your customer/user will just launch whatever you put in it. No
need to install ruby or any gems.</p>

<p>I gave it a try yesterday on my <a href="https://github.com/eduvo/zabbix-ruby-client">zabbix-ruby-client</a> gem, and after a few
tweaks (mostly because I wanted to use an unpublished version of my gem), it
all worked pretty fine. Result is a tarball of 8M. Uploaded to the server (an
old squeeze), it just ran the self-contained ruby 2.1.5 with no hassle. It
reminded me a bit of the feeling when you upload a go executable on the
server. Really neat.</p>

<h2 id="palm-control:7b1eab39a4e6e397eafd98271e67cb67">Palm control</h2>

<p>There are tiny things that can change a lot. My recent tiny thing is the palm
control technique. Every sunday when I prepare Green Ruby I do a huge amount
of copy pasting all over the place. Recently I found on a post about keyboard
someone talking about the palm control technique for avoiding the copypaste
fatigue.</p>

<p>Well, you need to have a keyboard that makes it possible. Mine is a <a href="http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/10104">Logitech washable k310</a>.
I already liked its look, and even better, it&rsquo;s perfect for
this palm thing because keys are prominent. Use the palm to push control and
then it&rsquo;s only a matter of hitting c or v with the index. Honestly, it changed
my life!</p>

<h2 id="1000-subscribers:dfd863a69df72c13bbe5f0b5d11c54ce">1000 subscribers</h2>

<p>After the 100th Greenruby last week, we get the 1000th subscriber to the email
newsletter this week. Welcome George :) So for the occasion I refreshed the
<a href="http://mose.cartodb.com/viz/6a4d431e-d6b7-11e3-8757-0e10bcd91c2b/embed_map">subscribers map</a> on cartodb. About half of the subscribers are in the US,
but there is a total of 73 countries represented, which is pretty neat. But
this is based on the ip used for subscribing, so it&rsquo;s not totally accurate.</p>

<h2 id="fighting-logs-pollution:dfd863a69df72c13bbe5f0b5d11c54ce">Fighting logs pollution</h2>

<p>Some time ago, on edition 82, I posted a link to my webalizer stats for the
greenruby website. Fatal mistake, I had referrers stats enabled and I got
somehow listed somewhere. The consequence was a lot of fake traffic with only
purpose to get links listed in my referrers section. After removing this
section from webalizer config, and moving the url, the fake traffic was still
there. Like a blind wave. This was pretty annoying.</p>

<p>So I began to take some drastic measures. Because I didn&rsquo;t have referrers
anymore in my stats, I went to my apache logs (yes it&rsquo;s an old server, still
running apache2) and fire up a:</p>

<pre><code>tail -5000 greenruby.org-access.log | cut -d' ' -f11 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
</code></pre>

<p>This give me a nice view of the recent referrers. Fake ones are easy to
notice. And that the fake traffic was only coming from a handful of ips, so I
just made a few:</p>

<pre><code>iptables -A INPUT -s &lt;ip&gt; -j DROP
</code></pre>

<p>The result was radically efficient. Certainly I had less volume but it&rsquo;s now
much cleaner. But it makes it clear that having clean volume stats for traffic
on your website is not that easy. There are a bunch of fake traffic sources
that you may not suspect.</p>

<h2 id="new-server-soon:dfd863a69df72c13bbe5f0b5d11c54ce">New server soon</h2>

<p>I got a new job 2 month ago at <a href="http://gandi.net">gandi</a>, and there is some nice <a href="https://www.gandi.net/hosting/iaas">VPS
hosting</a> there. I can have a machine just for Green Ruby there. It can be
neat and open some options. Green Ruby website is still very static. Various
attempts to improve it with a search engine didn&rsquo;t end up to something
concluding yet. Maybe this time it will.</p>

<p>That also may be the occasion to build up a distribution system and move out
of mailchimp. I looked around and all I found was php based. So I will
probably just write my own ruby scripts, the <a href="https://github.com/mikel/mail">mail gem</a> looks great and the
rest is a question of configuring a postfix with correct <a href="http://www.linuxlasse.net/linux/howtos/Postfix_with_DKIM_%28OpenDKIM%29_and_SPF">SPF and DKIM
setup</a>.</p>

<h2 id="je-suis-charlie:dfd863a69df72c13bbe5f0b5d11c54ce">Je suis Charlie</h2>

<p>Well, this tragedy that happened this Thursday in France impacts a lot of
people. Somehow, it perhaps impacts me more than the average. When I was
younger I went to art school to become a cartoonist, and finally I changed my
mind. But I knew the work of the victims of this slaughter. They were icons in
the French cartoon world.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really sad, first because this is murder, second because the irrational
impact it will have on society. This is crazy how a handful of brain-dead
punks can bend history. Now France is going to become even more paranoid. I
already was so uncomfortable when they began to send military with assault
rifles wander in the train stations in Paris. It&rsquo;s not going to get better.</p>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>This week is the 100th edition of Green Ruby, it&rsquo;s also the first one of 2015.
This week the <a href="http://sixgun.org/episodes/lo370">Linux Outlaws</a> broadcasted their last show, and Rebecca
Watson left the <a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/495">Skeptics Guide to the Universe</a>. Those are 2 podcasts that
I never list in the Green Ruby list (they are not really on topic) but I
rarely miss any of them. Too bad they leave. I thought about it too, but no, I
will stay.</p>

<p>So, happy new year or, as we say in french: Bananier!</p>

<p>For 100 weeks already I gathered those links and sent them to whoever wants
them. Every damn single week. Just for the fun of it. This is a kind of
personal kata, it keeps me in the loop. I just make my exercise in a way I can
share it. And my streak of never missing one week is a kind of personal
challenge.</p>

<p>There is now 971 subscribers to the mail newsletter, a whole lot of people
prefer to subscribe using the RSS feed, and the website has 8 or 9k visits per
month. But this is still a side project, with no business behind it. Just one
single guy and a couple of friends sharing the result of their weekly review
of the news of their craft.</p>

<p>So, as you can notice, the edito becomes a rant, and is going to get a bit
longer. For a while I was trying to keep it short just because it sits on the
top of the letter. What matters are the links and not the ranting. By moving
the blah blah at the bottom, I free myself from format constraints and can
unleash my writing desires. muahaha. Not that I have much to say. But you can
consider this new section of Green Ruby as the last screen displayed in <a href="http://www.chucklorre.com/index-bbt.php">The
Big Bang Theory</a>, where producers display some random thoughts, rants or
anecdote. You need to pause the video for being able to read them. Yeah I know
I could just blog like everybody else. But it&rsquo;s just convenient for me to
include this writing in my weekly process.</p>

<p>I also improved formatting for text-only diffusion. There is still something
bugging me about the link tracking, which is mandatory when using the free
tier of Mailchimp service. I guess I will have to find a way around: either I
will get away from mailchimp, either I will find a sponsor to pay for removing
the tracking (sounds funny when I say it that way, no?). Goddamn I hate
tracking-by-default. Maybe I will end up setting up my own postfix with some
mailman. Or use something? If you know a good free software self-hosted
solution for newsletters feel free to drop me a mail.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how many times I saw dev add google analytics on their templates
and at the end nobody was going to check stats except for volume metrics. If
you only need volumetric data, use your web server logs! If you really need
fine metrics, why not consider using self-hosted analytics like <a href="http://piwik.org">Piwik</a>?</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I don&rsquo;t hate analytics. What bothers me is what is made of
those data. Many companies chose as a business model to consider the user as a
merchandise. And most of the time they are not clear about it.</p>

<p>Oh, one last word, next week I will prepare an option so you can chose to
receive only the links and no rant. Or only the rant and no links. Maybe I
will make each section of the letter opt-out too, if you never listen to
podcasts why should you get those, right? I just like choice.</p>
