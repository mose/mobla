## Getting back into writing

A few months ago, I got tired of leading [Greenruby](http://fgreenruby.org) 
publication and Xenor accepted to jump in and take the publisher role. 
I'm very grateful about it. But as a secundary effect, I lost that ranting 
channel I got used to abuse. Each week, I was getting somehow acustomed 
to send some rant with the list of links.

Now it's time to get back into a publisher mood. I have various thoughts
that could deserve sharing, or at least, publication. Well I don't tweet much 
and I hate facebook, so my media coverage may be a little tiny. 

But that's not really a problem. It's not like I have some agenda. 
I just wish to exercise my right to reflect aloud on various topics, bring to 
the open some personal and/or original thoughts. Nothing more. Whoever reads, 
do it in silence.
