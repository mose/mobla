              <p>This week is the 100th edition of Green Ruby, it&rsquo;s also the first one of 2015.
This week the <a href="http://sixgun.org/episodes/lo370">Linux Outlaws</a> broadcasted their last show, and Rebecca
Watson left the <a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/495">Skeptics Guide to the Universe</a>. Those are 2 podcasts that
I never list in the Green Ruby list (they are not really on topic) but I
rarely miss any of them. Too bad they leave. I thought about it too, but no, I
will stay.</p>

<p>So, happy new year or, as we say in french: Bananier!</p>

<p>For 100 weeks already I gathered those links and sent them to whoever wants
them. Every damn single week. Just for the fun of it. This is a kind of
personal kata, it keeps me in the loop. I just make my exercise in a way I can
share it. And my streak of never missing one week is a kind of personal
challenge.</p>

<p>There is now 971 subscribers to the mail newsletter, a whole lot of people
prefer to subscribe using the RSS feed, and the website has 8 or 9k visits per
month. But this is still a side project, with no business behind it. Just one
single guy and a couple of friends sharing the result of their weekly review
of the news of their craft.</p>

<p>So, as you can notice, the edito becomes a rant, and is going to get a bit
longer. For a while I was trying to keep it short just because it sits on the
top of the letter. What matters are the links and not the ranting. By moving
the blah blah at the bottom, I free myself from format constraints and can
unleash my writing desires. muahaha. Not that I have much to say. But you can
consider this new section of Green Ruby as the last screen displayed in <a href="http://www.chucklorre.com/index-bbt.php">The
Big Bang Theory</a>, where producers display some random thoughts, rants or
anecdote. You need to pause the video for being able to read them. Yeah I know
I could just blog like everybody else. But it&rsquo;s just convenient for me to
include this writing in my weekly process.</p>

<p>I also improved formatting for text-only diffusion. There is still something
bugging me about the link tracking, which is mandatory when using the free
tier of Mailchimp service. I guess I will have to find a way around: either I
will get away from mailchimp, either I will find a sponsor to pay for removing
the tracking (sounds funny when I say it that way, no?). Goddamn I hate
tracking-by-default. Maybe I will end up setting up my own postfix with some
mailman. Or use something? If you know a good free software self-hosted
solution for newsletters feel free to drop me a mail.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how many times I saw dev add google analytics on their templates
and at the end nobody was going to check stats except for volume metrics. If
you only need volumetric data, use your web server logs! If you really need
fine metrics, why not consider using self-hosted analytics like <a href="http://piwik.org">Piwik</a>?</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I don&rsquo;t hate analytics. What bothers me is what is made of
those data. Many companies chose as a business model to consider the user as a
merchandise. And most of the time they are not clear about it.</p>

<p>Oh, one last word, next week I will prepare an option so you can chose to
receive only the links and no rant. Or only the rant and no links. Maybe I
will make each section of the letter opt-out too, if you never listen to
podcasts why should you get those, right? I just like choice.</p>

<p><a href="http://greenruby.org/">Green Ruby</a> is a weekly newsletter that I’m publishing about ruby, rails, javascript and web development in general. I am preparing a website to make it more collective and here is the ‘about’ page, not yet published, but I was thinking it could be interesting to share it before the website is all ready.</p>

<h2 id="genesis:1c34dfda6e65228c3dbbf6fb2d30812e">Genesis</h2>

<p>The Newsletter began in june 2012 from the habit I had to send weekly newsletter in <a href="http://codegreenit.com/">Codegreen</a> for our team to know what is happening in our company,. That was purely a teamwork tool for general transparency. But with time passing I also included there some links to what I was finding around that would be of interest for my geek colleagues.</p>

<p>That CodeGreen Internal newsletter began to be cluttered with various links at the bottom of it. So I decided to separate that links gathering bunch in another newsletter. But then it could also be useful for my friends, out of the scope of our team.</p>

<h2 id="green-birth:1c34dfda6e65228c3dbbf6fb2d30812e">Green Birth</h2>

<p>At that time I had to test <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a> service for one of our projects, so because they offer a free package when volume is not too big, I thought I should just create that newsletter as a public freely available publication.</p>

<p>So in february 2013 I sent the first Green Ruby Newsletter to 3 subscribers. Well, mostly our team :) Then it became a weekly habit, so I got a domain name for it, and organically it’s growing slowly.</p>

<h2 id="the-redactor-gear:1c34dfda6e65228c3dbbf6fb2d30812e">The redactor gear</h2>

<p>Codegreen paid for my <a href="http://newsblur.com/">Newsblur</a> account so I can follow a bunch of feeds. Google reader was my first tool but well, they are closing, and actually Newsblur is much better. It’s open source and the guy that makes it does a great job (too bad it’s in python and not in ruby).</p>

<p>I’m also loading a bunch of podcasts on my phone and after having tried a lot of podcast softwares I’m really happy with <a href="http://www.podkicker.com/">Podkicker</a>, it’s just very convenient and it has all I need with the free version. So in my 40 minutes commuting to go to work, I just get the ears busy. I tried to use <a href="https://gpodder.net/user/mose">Gpodder</a> but it’s not totally perfect and the support in podcast clients is not as good as it should be. So I don’t stick on it, maybe it will evolve and I will get back to it.</p>

<p>But I also get a lot of news by just wandering around on <a href="https://geekli.st/">Geekli.st</a>, on <a href="https://coderbits.com/">Coderbits</a>, hacker news, and I subscribed to a bunch of various newsletters. I also watch teh new gems feeds from <a href="https://twitter.com/RubyGemsAlt">@rubygems-alt</a> and I retweet stuff of interest on <a href="https://twitter.com/cogtw">@cogtw</a> account (those 2 are my alternate twitter identities).</p>

<p>Each week <a href="https://github.com/tubaxenor">William</a> (aka xenor) also sends me a list of links. But I definitely don’t use any facebook feeds. For some reason, this is a place I avoid the most I can.</p>

<h2 id="what-next:1c34dfda6e65228c3dbbf6fb2d30812e">What next ?</h2>

<p>My ambition there is to keep it non-commercial, and change it to be more community driven. The preparation of the letter is eating a big part of my saturdays for the last 13 weeks and I don’t think I can keep up the same pace for long time.</p>

<p>The idea I have about the community driven thing is by engineering some automation on the news gathering (to replace newsblur), have a place where the news can be triaged by various people, a little bit like it is on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> with a vote system. But the gathering won’t limit to blog posts and rss feeds, there would also be podcasts and video feeds. There is now a lot of possibilities in automation on feeds aggregation. I worked on a project that already does that feeds aggregation, named “the Blux”. And I expect to replicate parts of it for my Green Ruby Engine.</p>

<p>But also, as usual, this project is also an occasion to play with recent technologies or stuff I want to know more about, otherwise where is the fun ? So here comes <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>, on the top of <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> with <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">mongoDB</a>, and there will be much more on the road (thinking about trying <a href="http://af83.github.io/sponges/">Sponges</a> too).</p>
