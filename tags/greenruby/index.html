<p>If you only ever have lived in only one country, you really should consider
fixing it. Going <a href="https://inassets1-internationsgmbh.netdna-ssl.com/static/bundles/internationsexpatinsider/pdf/expat_insider_2016_the_internations_survey.pdf">live in another country</a> for some years or more is just
such a way towards a richer life. It&rsquo;s usually easy to recognize people that
are multi-rooted, as they often have an increased depth in their personal
philosophy.</p>

<p>We are lucky, in our craft, to have various opportunities to travel and work
remotely, or for foreign companies. Many of you are already aware of those
benefits. But to the others I can just say this: use this opportunity! Get
out!</p>

<h2 id="to-be-remote-or-not-to-be-remote:1376d8ec44d87fc0206977e0453baca2">To be remote or not to be remote &hellip;</h2>

<p>Earlier this week I read <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-work-from-home-oleg-vishnepolsky">an article on linkedin, deliberately
anti-remote</a>, and a bit later on <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-economics-of-working-remotely-28d4173e16e2#.43ewevr3t">another one very pro-remote on
freecodecamp</a>. I&rsquo;m tempted to think one is the response to the other. But
maybe not.</p>

<p>The fact is that switching to a remote organization is a tricky move. It feels
like the move from monolith to micro-services, honestly. People that make
decisions about it rarely envision the extent of the change. And those change
look similar in nature. Team architecture and software design are not that
foreign. More autonomy for services or people, self-contained activity,
requirement for clear communication channels and protocols, extensive
architecture for monitoring, reporting or just plain visibility, more
debugging tools and processes, and much more.</p>

<p>The same way one will have to think about all those when switching to
microservices, the one that thinks about making his team remote will also have
to consider the exact same parameters. But that is all on the principles.
About the implementation, remote teams really need a strong chat culture, an
easy and transparent logging policy for all communication channels, various
tooling similar to chatops tools for assisting communication activity. Remote
organization also need to have all their processes online, and not need much
(if at all) any synchronous meetings.</p>

<p>From my perspective there are various very beneficial side-effects to make a
team remote. There is more traceability as everything is online and not in
corridors anymore. In some cases that I experienced, it also leads to a less
arbitrary perception on team members, because they can be judged more on
results (if you have measure tools prepared accordingly) than on attitude and
mouth-skills (did you noticed that irl meetings are sometimes just a
mouth-o-cracy?). But it&rsquo;s accurate to say that on a short term, it is more
time consuming. The real benefit rises on the long run.</p>

<p>What I didn&rsquo;t find in any articles on the matter, is the life-cycle dimension.
A software project has a life expectancy, from a business point of view. It&rsquo;s
the same game as with the technical debt. It is acceptable business-wise to
live at credit for a time, until a certain milestone. A lot of projects are
just extended MVPs intended to convince big money that they could deserve some
attention. For such project, you want very fast paced environment. It&rsquo;s easier
to coerce your <s>slaves</s> employees to go above and beyond the
expectations, when in a physical environment. This is a disposable context,
and you can skip team debt as much as technical debt. And you really need
physicality for that purpose.</p>

<p>So, I would say, if a company is not making the move towards remote
organization, maybe there are very good reasons for that. But I will be very
cautious to understand what are the real reasons. They may stink. And if they
are remote, but they just came to it recently, I would be careful about the
tooling they prepared for it.</p>

<h2 id="working-out:1ea5a5016d2b050f17a7e1c15a7c459b">Working out</h2>

<p>During the past year I have been doing some working out. No no there is no
fitbit involved. Are you crazy? My physical activity includes a strict refusal
of pointless efforts. I deliberately choose to use the bike rather than the
bus, it has the purpose of transportation,. But just getting sweaty for the
sake of it, well, that&rsquo;s not my thing. I&rsquo;m talking about a git-commit working
out. I decided to have one commit a day on github (minimum) and instead of the
fitbit or whatever phone app, I used the github timeline as a monitor.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s one year now and I got my <a href="https://github.com/mose/">github
timeline</a> all green. In itself it doesn&rsquo;t achieve
anything except for myself. I mean, it&rsquo;s quite easy to fill up a timeline with
fake entries. But by getting this challenge of one commit a day, it led to
some valuable outcomes. I got some more work projects validated to be
published as open source. Whenever I was not feeling inspired for code commit,
I was chasing typoes in my Readme&rsquo;s, or dependencies upgrades in my gems.</p>

<p>Overall, it had quite a good impact on my coding publication, on the updating
of my blog (well, that blpg mostly gather the rants I do here), and various
other small details. Well, I&rsquo;m not a very famous open source coder, just an
average joe. But a persistent one. It&rsquo;s very easy to just upload shit on
github and forget about it. Having this regular commitment made me come back
on some old things, keep them current somehow.</p>

<p>Getting some routine in place that includes open source activity has various
benefits, even when you don&rsquo;t have an audience. You should try it.</p>

<h2 id="the-reign-of-the-virtual:161a22387a1160601decdc89dcca85bc">The reign of the virtual</h2>

<p>Yesterday morning, the hunt for Pokemons opened here in Taiwan. I have been
watching the crazy adoption of this new trend in the past few weeks. And
knowing the asian culture, I suspect Japan and Taiwan are going to make the
craziness in the rest of the world just like mild interest.</p>

<p>There are few occasions to notice a huge shift in civilization as clearly as
this one. For sure we have noticed that our fellow human neighbors spend more
and more time the nose on their mobile devices. But this pokemon enthusiasm
bring it to a whole new level. It proves the virtual now begins to overrule
the real in term of social conventions. Well, not for everybody, not
everywhere, but in a proportion that is relevant enough to be noticeable.</p>

<p>The real world always have been ruling the social activities. Laws and
conventions were deciding who is in and who is out, what to do and how to do
it right. This is going to change. My main concern is that the future of the
social activity is in the hands of private companies. Those companies,
legitimately driven by profit, consider the user as a resource, that requires
gathering and retention strategies. Like herds. The whole privacy fight is not
going to stand too long as cattle (oops I meant user) data is the 21st century
gold, and economy (and crazy need for constant growth) depends on it.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m not really happy from this deduction. We are getting captured with
advanced weapons generated by behavioral economics and other clever social
sciences. They are manipulation tools. Just tools. Sure you can do good with
them, but such powerful tools of mass manipulation are not going to stay
neutral in the hands of those who want to squeeze our essence (feels like a
matrix metaphor, yeah I&rsquo;m aware of it).</p>

<p>Our mobile devices become interfaces now. Direct access to our behaviors. They
already have been great tracking and data collection devices for years. Now
they begin to be manipulative with much more effectiveness. Sure, the pokemon
hunting doesn&rsquo;t seem to harm much, but I see it as only a beginning, a
trigger. It just makes sense. Everybody can see the success it has. Certainly
there are already hundreds of projects that are seeing the light right now at
this instant just under the visibility of that opportunity. And many of those
will be clever, engaging, and impacting on the real world, by the way of
mobile devices, the reverse-remote-control for getting a grip on every human
being.</p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;m an old guy, I&rsquo;m of course very worried about this future. I have
memories of a past where it was so much different. But the young generations,
seeing this as the norm, will just fall for it, without question. Don&rsquo;t get me
wrong, I love good tools that can make our lives easier. But they are tools.
The intent of their usage matters. Augmented reality just seems to be going to
be used with very nefarious intents.</p>

<p>hrum. Well yeah, this is a rant, that&rsquo;s nothing more. Not an essay, not a
study. Just my guts getting spread over the table. Take it easy :)</p>

<h2 id="chatops-and-machine-learning:e9b36217e79099e03b1370ffadd11329">Chatops and machine learning</h2>

<p>Since I slowly becomes the chatops specialist where I work, I get to think I
want more. Since the beginning we have been interacting with programs
essentially with graphical interfaces. First asynchronous if we think about
the web, now more and more synchronous, but they are interfaces that are not
human. They are designed for giving control to the operators of those
interfaces.</p>

<p>But the more we advance in autonomy of our programs, the more we should trust
them to sort the information by priorities. The interfaces like Siri, Echo,
are much more &lsquo;human&rsquo; and conversational. It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to
speculate that interfaces are going to die one day, except for very
specialized usages, and more interaction will be just more conversational.</p>

<p>In the course of my development of interactive agents for technical needs, I
noticed that adding just a little bit of intelligence and memory in those
agents goes a long way in usability. Especially in chatops, a lot of the
actions required from those agents are predicable and repetitive. The
development of new features should follow the recognition of those patterns
and shorten the path to accomplish some actions. That&rsquo;s pretty much my job.</p>

<p>But coding this continually is not very cost effective. Tools also change,
then patterns evolve. Now all I can think about is a way to design an irc bot
that learns by itself. Some program that does real meta-programming and
considers its commands as data rather than hard-coded pre-conceived path for
the information to flow.</p>

<p>If you know some tools that already do that, can you fire me a mail?</p>

<h2 id="innovation-and-consensus:d227510bfc1c353e16b44869362b5410">Innovation and Consensus</h2>

<p>Last week I got to check out 2 javascript frontend frameworks, <a href="https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo">Choo</a>
(the cute framwework) and <a href="http://cycle.js.org/">Cycle.js</a> (the streams power). It feels
that nowadays React is eating the frontend world, but there is actually a lot
of non-marginal alternatives. It made me think that there is something tricky
with the process of innovation. It is born from disagreement. It feeds with
discontent.</p>

<p>Those frameworks are born from the refusal to consider React as a consensus,
hence it generates an alternative path, exploring different paradigms. In my
opinion, and from an global point of view, it&rsquo;s a sign of vivacity of an
ecosystem. Diversity of species guarantees a larger span of choice for the
natural selection and a faster evolution.</p>

<p>But consensus and normative approaches have so many virtues. Damn, this is
tricky. Well, here is the catch. Unicity in the software ecosystem creates
stability, which in turn creates comfort for the actors involved in the
industry. Habits get stronger, mobility is easier, interoperability leads to
bigger systems with long life-cycles. This is good.</p>

<p>On another hand diversity creates instability, challenges the developers and
makes it harder to find common grounds. It favors exploration and smaller
systems with shorter life-cycles. In a diverse ecosystem, paradigms and new
ideas are born and die quickly. And I think it&rsquo;s a much more rich ecosystem.</p>

<p>For some reason this duality reminds me of the cathedral and the bazaar. It&rsquo;s
totally unrelated, actually, but maybe there is some kind of interesting
parallel in this metaphor collision. But beyond that, there is a real
antagonism for developers, and an opposing interest between the development
workforce and the software as a living species.</p>

<p>And I have the feeling that on the long run, diversity and innovation win. So
you better get used to the discomfort it brings. Train yourself to jump from
one framework to another. Don&rsquo;t let yourself getting lazy by going to the
comfortable consensus systematically. This ability to cope with change is your
best hope for staying current. Because the change if the way of the evolution.</p>

<p>Yeah there are weeks like that, I don&rsquo;t have inspiration. Or I&rsquo;m lazy. Or I&rsquo;m
too busy writing <a href="https://github.com/Gandi/hubot-phabs/commits">javascript tests</a> with mocha, chai and or sinon.
Already having 3 times more lines of code in tests that in code and even if
coverage says 80% I know for a fact that there are many more cases I need to
test. Anyways, there is too much fun for me to just go beyond the traditional
gathering of the links for this week. Can&rsquo;t write a rant. No way.</p>

<h2 id="the-in-culture-of-encryption:51c044384329e8bd96399bebc071607b">The (in)culture of encryption</h2>

<p>A couple weeks ago I had found out that a friend was keeping his passwords in
a google sheets document. I was horrified. But he&rsquo;s a normal person. I mean,
not more technical than the next guy, or just a little. He&rsquo;s using the web
interface of gmail for his mail, like many people do (I even know very
technical people doing it, which is still boggling me). I looked around and
found <a href="https://www.mailvelope.com/">mailvelope</a>. So I hook him up on it and now he can use GPG.</p>

<p>In the past 20 years I have seen the timid evolution of personal encryption.
Oh there are initiatives like <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a>, various simple tools like
<a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">passowrdstore</a> or <a href="https://github.com/henryboldi/felony">Felony</a> that I discovered this week. But it
seems that encryption don&rsquo;t really stick to the usages, unless you have a
specific thought about it. Fortunately there is some wise generalization of
SSL for inter-server communication, with initiatives like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">lets
encrypt</a>. But inter-personal communication is still wide open.</p>

<p>More and more it is well-known that our data is food for various corporation,
governmental agencies, and dark organizations. What will it take for getting
the users to claim better privacy? Will it ever happen?</p>

<p>I mean, yes for sure people can use the tools. But it&rsquo;s cumbersome. Until
encryption is embedded in our tools and services, it simply won&rsquo;t spread
significantly enough. There are some projects like <a href="https://caliopen.org/">Caliopen</a> that
try to do so. On another hand, we have seen some services like
<a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> which provide such service, and even some mainstream
providers like <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/04/forget-apple-vs-fbi-whatsapp-just-switched-encryption-billion-people/">Whatsapp</a> jump into the full-encryption train. So
maybe there is hope? I still wonder what&rsquo;s the part played by Facebook (which
now owns Whatsapp) in that move.</p>

<p>The recent fight between Apple and US government was supposed to set some kind
of precedent. Too bad it was aborted. But they would have complied at the end,
this is my bet. Now that encryption is the only way for companies to legally
keep their users safe from legal (and illegal) inquiries, maybe more will
consider it?</p>

<p>If you have two onces of technical savyness, please stop running naked on the
streets. Gear up and use encryption whenever possible.</p>

<h2 id="open-code-a-chance-for-improvement:9c5419396d421f66fa0cc8a4eac9d46e">Open code, a chance for improvement</h2>

<p>Since I&rsquo;m writing code I try to publish as much as I can as open source
components. But I had occasion to work in situations where it was not
possible. And I noticed some serious differences in the result.</p>

<p>When you publish some code on, say, Github, you can just throw it as is and be
done with it. Then you merely use github as a repository provider and don&rsquo;t
care much about anything else. But when you begin to spend some time doing it,
you notice that external contributor can bring great fixes, help detect bugs,
and generally speaking make your code more valuable in itself.</p>

<p>But this is a two-ways road. To invite people to collaborate you need to
address a certain amount of little details. Writing a decently clear README is
a demonstration of politeness for any passing guest. It&rsquo;s just more inviting.
Making sure you have a complete enough test suite guarantees you can be sure
external contributions won&rsquo;t mess up existing code (if writing tests in itself
was not motivating enough). Refactoring your code by following
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/">codeclimate</a> advises will break huge methods in small pieces,
making things easier to be improved. Enforcing some kind of <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">style guide</a>
will avoid people to get confused by a non-standard code-art.
(that person could be you in one year).</p>

<p>All those aspects, when you work at a company as the only coder on one piece
of code, you don&rsquo;t have that much incentive to enforce them. And I know about
it because I have seen a huge lot of legacy code that was written that way.
With lame tests that only purpose was to enforce code coverage without really
testing much, weird code style, epic methods, no instructions. If it&rsquo;s just
you and a couple of friends that you see every day, it&rsquo;s fine, you can deal
with it. For a time.</p>

<p>The fact is that exposing your code brings an incentive to work on the
(apparently) non-essential aspects of your code. But those aspects really
bring a huge improvement on the long term. Which leads me to consider that
opening source code is a way that can lead to make it better.</p>

<p>An usually, I noticed that the bosses don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s open or not, as far
as there is no trade secrets revealed. But well we write so much code that if
business-neutral for many things. At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s only the matter
of asking the boss if you can free this or that code, and then it&rsquo;s on its
way. Even more if the code is published under an organization on github, there
is even more incentive to make it clean, and it will also help possible
candidates to understand what kind of stack you are dealing with, and what
kind of principle you try to enforce. Even if it&rsquo;s actually only enforced in
your open source code and the hidden code is messy. Haha.</p>

<p>So, I ask you now, what in your current codebase could you extract as an open
source gem? or node package?</p>

<h2 id="remote-working:150acb3fbf488af89de91dbfbd571391">Remote working</h2>

<p>For some random strange reason I had a lot of links this week about remote
working websites. I know it&rsquo;s a very real topic for our craft. But I still see
a lot of companies that have hard time coping with the concept.</p>

<p>On one hand, there is a shortage of technically skilled staff. The growth of
the tech industry and especially the online services is way too fast for the
education system to catch up. It&rsquo;s been like that for pretty much 20 years
now. And there is an unbalanced repartition between where the growing
companies are and where the growing population of techies are. So it would
only make sense that either relocation would be much easier or remote working
much more widespread, no? Well, no. Relocation is bound to laws that are not
driven by the only technical area. And remoting is dependent on a cultural and
also legal shift.</p>

<p>Because working with remote staff, many of us know what it means. First it
involves a level of trust in the staff that is unprecedented. The same level
of trust you need to invest when working with a contractor, actually. Then the
old-fashioned control and command system in place with traditional management
systems gets totally inefficient.</p>

<p>More even, to be efficient with a remote team means adopting a work
organization and tools that are specifically thought for this setup. From what
I can experience, it&rsquo;s either one or the other. When half the staff works in
an office locally it&rsquo;s not easy (yet not impossible) to be efficient with
another half remote.</p>

<p>Some stuff will be likely to happen locally with old ways of oral
communication and meetings with sparse note-taking. That will put the remote
staff in the dark of some parts of the internal process. It may create a
double-speed kind of organization, there is the ones that are full speed and
the ones that are just, well, not in the core. Oh it&rsquo;s still possible to make
it work. It&rsquo;s just harder.</p>

<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s like the web and the mobile. Slowly companies need to become
remote-first and then eventually also work on local office-based scale. But
there are still various barriers for having a real remote-friendly world
anyways. The legal status is not clear,m for example, money transfers between
countries, compliances with social coverage conventions, no international law
seems to cover international employment with individuals.</p>

<p>From what I can understand, remote working from a distant country is still a
hack, legally speaking. Companies need to find tricks. Luckily, hacking is
something we are not bad at. But still. I wonder when it&rsquo;s going to change,
and see a legal ground for a really normal remote working context.</p>
