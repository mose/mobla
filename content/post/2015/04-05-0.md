## Multiple inheritance simulation

This is a bit twisted. In ruby, as you know, you cannot use multiple
inheritance. But the flexibility of the language, especially the
metaprogramming aspect, opens the door for some cheating. Check out [this
code][inheritance], it tricks it by declaring the first class as the super
class and the remaining classes as modules included in that super class.
Pretty acrobatic and elegant, imho.

## About vaping

Well this has been my burden for 30 years, and I'm not proud of it. But last
week it finally ended. I quit smoking. But this was kindof a trick, as it was
made possible by switching to [vaping][vaping]. It certainly doesn't solve the
nicotine addiction issue, but I'm very happy with this move and hopeful for a
gradual freedom.

I also found out that this vaping practice is very geeky. The hardware part is
quite elaborate, vaping devices are really neat piece of work, there are a
bunch of vendors. The liquidware is also quite a subject of hacking.
Technically it's not that hard to do it yourself. Not surprising that I
discovered this vaping practice in geeks circles.
