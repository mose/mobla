<h2 id="welcome-jessie:d9f4d66fbdcd986833b23a4199ad62c2">Welcome Jessie</h2>

<p>Ok, right. Maybe you don&rsquo;t care, but this saturday <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie">Jessie</a> was
officially released. It&rsquo;s the next stable version of debian, version 8.0, and
it&rsquo;s great that it finally got out. Debian release cycles are certainly not as
fast as Ubuntu, but the stuff in there is more stable. And well, in my
personal case, I work in a place where everything is in debian wheezy and can
now finally get upgraded.</p>

<p>Actually I have been using Ubuntu on my desktop for some time. The reason was
that I wanted to be able to help people to transition to linux, without being
overloaded with support. So I had to know how ubuntu work. But last year I
switched back to the original debian and I have been pretty happy about that.
There is less cruft and opinionated choices (no freaking unity as a default
window manager). And it&rsquo;s pretty straightfoward in the install process. I
suspect even non-techies could give it a try (I know some that did).</p>

<h2 id="state-surveillance-in-france:2e160e3cd77d85bf5cb357e6e45cadd1">State surveillance in France</h2>

<p>What happened this week in France is quite shocking. How can they be so long
to make useful laws and so quick to pass harmful ones? Well the move began in
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/11/french-officials-internet-users-real-time-law">December last year</a>. Some call it a French Patriot act. This
is not the first time there is an attempt from French government to enforce
stronger control on the internet. The pressure of lobbies and media industries
have been pushing hard to preserve their interests.</p>

<p>But this time, it&rsquo;s just about copying the NSA, and get legal requirement for
service providers to host the black boxes. Seems that the Snowden revelations
gave the lawmakers some ideas. The impact is not anecdotal in the French
society. Some service providers announce they will leave the country like
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/11/french-officials-internet-users-real-time-law">Altern</a> (French), others <a href="http://blogs.mediapart.fr/blog/laurent-chemla/170415/lettre-ceux-qui-sen-foutent">call to action</a> (French). Both
Valentin and Laurent are long time activists in the French landscape. I know
them for a while. Funny how things turn out, I&rsquo;m now working in the company
they founded in 99 (and passed hands in 2005).</p>

<p>But all this makes me think that we are facing a technicality. The real thing
is systemic. It seems that we failed, as a civilization, to regain control
over our systems. The course of evolution is going to lead to more control to
the machines, more dependence on the computerized information. Up to a point
where our insignificance as human being will become really obvious.</p>

<p>We, as small makers of this computerized universe, should have some part of
responsibility. Is there a way that we can bend the course of history by the
small choices we make? Can we not take decisions in regard of how to implement
solutions, in a way that we can preserve a margin of freedom and respect for
the human species? I&rsquo;m not sure, at this point, there is anything we can do.
But if we don&rsquo;t try, we will never know. Think about it. You build systems.
You shape the world. Your choice matters.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-inheritance-simulation:a9a546e37849f6a570839940ccf98c98">Multiple inheritance simulation</h2>

<p>This is a bit twisted. In ruby, as you know, you cannot use multiple
inheritance. But the flexibility of the language, especially the
metaprogramming aspect, opens the door for some cheating. Check out
<a href="https://gist.github.com/capitalist/473543b7ea24d461d030">this code</a>, it tricks it by declaring the first class as the super
class and the remaining classes as modules included in that super class.
Pretty acrobatic and elegant, imho.</p>

<h2 id="about-vaping:a9a546e37849f6a570839940ccf98c98">About vaping</h2>

<p>Well this has been my burden for 30 years, and I&rsquo;m not proud of it. But last
week it finally ended. I quit smoking. But this was kindof a trick, as it was
made possible by switching to <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5-facts-that-everyone-gets-wrong-about-vaping-1659938937">vaping</a>. It certainly doesn&rsquo;t solve the
nicotine addiction issue, but I&rsquo;m very happy with this move and hopeful for a
gradual freedom.</p>

<p>I also found out that this vaping practice is very geeky. The hardware part is
quite elaborate, vaping devices are really neat piece of work, there are a
bunch of vendors. The liquidware is also quite a subject of hacking.
Technically it&rsquo;s not that hard to do it yourself. Not surprising that I
discovered this vaping practice in geeks circles.</p>

<h2 id="green-ruby-new-generation:e04937da80b109c53cab9bf63b0a6b99">Green Ruby New Generation</h2>

<p>We had this week a very productive meeting with xenor and tysliu in our
preferred coffee shop. I explained more in detail my workflow and my quality
criterias. So now they can feed the links section and become the major editors
of Green Ruby. I Still keep the role of the publisher. I get their links, I
clean up stuff, verify freshness and reachability, remove superlatives, fix
category if needed.</p>

<p>Special thanks a lot to Xenor and Tysliu (aka. Simon). Now they do the heavy
lifting and they are the reason why Green Ruby is still in your mailbox every
week.</p>

<h2 id="drones-and-makers:84bb7b31097e7dff868fbef479daafb5">Drones and makers</h2>

<p>This is now obvious. We are going to get invaded by drones. Of course we will
pretend we control them, for a while. But I can bet it&rsquo;s not going to stand
too long. Their autonomy is a competitive factor, and, in our current society,
competitive is the Darwinian selective factor. It can be a bit scary.</p>

<p>But on another hand, when we geeks look at those things with our (never-aging)
kids eyes, we see fun toys. Look at the <a href="http://www.bgobeyond.co.uk/">B Flying car</a>. We can
<a href="http://diydrones.com/">do them ourselves</a>. Like we were able to tinker with the first computers, the
first radio stations. But now we have 3D printing. Yet not that affordable,
but it seems to get better. There is also that creepy <a href="http://the3doodler.com/">3Doodler</a>
thingie, and various other new techniques.</p>

<p>Maybe the Makers movement is the hope for humanity. Reclaim the daily small
things! Check that <a href="http://www.instructables.com/">instructable</a> website it&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Well yeah this all has nothing to do with webdev. Except from the fact that
open standards made possible to people like me to do the web myself. After a
time, it became a professional activity. Will we get professional makers in
the future and see a revival of craftsmanship? I really wonder.</p>

<h2 id="time-to-upgrade:d4567cfa55308712270d1f5b73098130">Time to upgrade</h2>

<p>This is a long time I plan to re-engineer the way Green Ruby is produced. Last
week I told Xenor and Simon I was thinking about giving it a break. I&rsquo;m not
that much anymore in the flow. Now my days are full ops and not that much dev.
But the guys didn&rsquo;t want to let me stop.</p>

<p>So we are going to organize things a little differently. Xenor and Simon,
which are full time rails developers, are going to handle the content more
extensively, and I will just manage the publication, plus some devops links.
So we need to get some tools ready to handle that new flow. Maybe, the time it
gets ready, we will take some time off. Maybe not.</p>

<p>What I wish is to have a way to let more people jump in, too. Maybe we will
get inspiration in how <a href="http://thechangelog.com/trello-as-a-cms/">the changelog</a> manages their news
flow. They based it on a <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> and it&rsquo;s quite clever. By chance I
explored the trello API recently and I can tell it&rsquo;s really good, very
suitable for custom automation.</p>

<p>This week, I will play lazy on the podcasts. I don&rsquo;t think they are that much
interesting anyways, and all that copy-pasting is exhausting. When some
podcasts stands out of the crowd, I will rather feature it in this rant.</p>

<h2 id="about-blogging:111d43eaf8a2a6adad496f0417e7f52c">About blogging</h2>

<p>Well, since that whole blogging thing began, I never have been very active on
it. Well, I have a <a href="http://blog.mose.com">blog</a> on Tumblr because I wanted to know how they
are doing it, I published various posts in the <a href="http://devtips.faria.co/authors.html#mose-ref">faria devtips</a>, and
after all, this rant could also count as a publication. So I think I will
gather them all under one unique site. A Jekyll github-pages kind, easy and
cheap.</p>

<p>After all, I&rsquo;m not sure the devtips website will stay up any longer. There
have been no post since the day I left. Too bad. It&rsquo;s a demonstration that
some collective actions can sometimes rely only on the energy of one person.</p>

<p>So, I made a <a href="http://mose.github.io/blog">new repo</a> on github for it, and I will gather whatever
stuff I can find that I wrote in there.</p>

<h2 id="lovely-freebsd:111d43eaf8a2a6adad496f0417e7f52c">Lovely FreeBSD</h2>

<p>At our Gandi office in Taipei I had to install a <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/">pfsense</a> server,
which is based on <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>. It was quite a pleasant experience,
actually. Last time I played a bit with BSD that was 12 years ago, and that
was not very smooth. I&rsquo;m happy to be given that occasion to see how it goes
now.</p>

<p>For now I&rsquo;m going to use it like if it was an <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a> with some
extra <a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source.html">OpenVPN</a> abilities. And it will also be a file server for the
LAN. Not sure yet how I will handle that.</p>

<h2 id="ruby-package-management:111d43eaf8a2a6adad496f0417e7f52c">Ruby package management</h2>

<p>When I got in my new job, I discovered a new way to manage server management.
They didn&rsquo;t want to use <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a>, or even <a href="https://rubygems.org/">ruby gems</a>, or
<a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/">pip</a> or anything that is not debian packages. It may sound quite harsh.
Since I came in ruby in 2010, rvm has been my best friend, bundle the second
one. But this approach is very developer-based. When you maintain large and
stable systems, it&rsquo;s more likely that you will not trust the bleeding edge
stuff and prefer confirmed publication of packages before using them. This is
an interesting slap on my face.</p>

<p>Of course there are the <a href="https://www.brightbox.com/docs/ruby/ubuntu/">brightbox</a> packages for Ubuntu, but that&rsquo;s
missing the point. A release has to be out for a certain time so it can be
strengthened by security reviews and proper production usage. There is a part
of the population for each language that is considering the instability of
current releases a normal trade-off. but there is a huge lot of other
companies that will wait patiently that things get stable enough for their
taste.</p>

<h2 id="working-abroad:a0091e7eb1dfeca477447c7e0b2e6425">Working abroad</h2>

<p>Our craft as webdev is clearly in huge demand. This provides an opportunity
for us to travel abroad, discover new cultures, widen our horizon. When I went
to live in Taiwan, I was not worried about finding a job. But when hunting for
a job abroad it can be tricky to find companies that will sponsor a visa, a
work permit, or whatever legal requirement is involved in each countries.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what the new initiative called <a href="http://techmeabroad.com">TechMeAbroad</a> aims to fix, by
listing only job opportunities for which a work permit is sponsored. As
<a href="http://jbarbier42.tumblr.com/post/112155851079/introducing-techmeabroad">Julien Barbier explains</a>, it will launch in march, and if you know of any
job offers that includes a visa or such thing, please let him know (or send it
to me I will pass it along), so we can feed that platform with some real data
quickly.</p>

<h2 id="so-long-ruby-1-9:a0091e7eb1dfeca477447c7e0b2e6425">So long ruby 1.9</h2>

<p>As planned, it&rsquo;s now time to say <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2015/02/23/support-for-ruby-1-9-3-has-ended/">byebye to ruby 1.9.3</a>. But there is still
so many old version of ruby in the wild. In debian squeeze, you gotta use 1.8.
In wheezy, you have 1.9. And there are still many servers that will refuse to
upgrade.</p>

<h2 id="pick-your-hero:a0091e7eb1dfeca477447c7e0b2e6425">Pick your hero</h2>

<p>The registration for <a href="http://rubyheroes.com/">Ruby Heroes 2015</a> is now open. Go vote for your
favorite ruby influential dev. You have until <a href="http://railsconf.com/">railsconf</a> that will happen
in april, in Atlanta this year.</p>

<h2 id="happy-year-of-the-goat:a9be2ef830fd7cbccc6ae0de53135b81">Happy year of the Goat</h2>

<p>Here it was Chinese New Year this week. A good occasion for those who are not
familiar with chinese state of the web to read about its <a href="http://designbeep.com/2015/02/20/free-download-chinese-new-year-icon-pack-50-icons/">web design trends 2015</a>.
This article is pretty deep and reflects accurately how China uses
its connectivity.</p>

<p>So, xin nian kuai le, and of course, gong xi fa cai. And if you need related
icons, <a href="http://designbeep.com/2015/02/20/free-download-chinese-new-year-icon-pack-50-icons/">here are some</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hello-in-firefox:a9be2ef830fd7cbccc6ae0de53135b81">Hello in Firefox</h2>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;m working from Taiwan with a French company, I was have been
searching for a decent solution for video conferencing. Because skype and
google-hangouts are just not things I like to use. I found out that new
versions of firefox include by default a one to one webrtc feature, named
<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-hello-video-and-voice-conversations-online">Hello</a>. It works pretty nicely. I also tried out <a href="https://glideroom.com/">Glideroom</a> and
<a href="https://hu.tt/">Hutt</a>. There are also heavier solutions that I tried in the past like the
<a href="http://bigbluebutton.org/">big blue button</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately some dude in the ops team pointed out that webrtc was <a href="https://blog.ipvanish.com/webrtc-security-hole-leaks-real-ip-addresses/">not
secure</a>, so it&rsquo;s not likely to become a standard for us. Hrum, well, that&rsquo;s
debatable how proprietary solutions are more secure. There is no way to get it
figured out. Anyways Webrtc became a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-webrtc-20150210/">w3c standard</a> recently, and the
section 12, named security, says: TBD. Let&rsquo;s hope it will be done properly.</p>

<p>Any of you have some first hand experience with any alternative video
conference system, please send me a mail with your feedback.</p>

<h2 id="damn-omnivore:f97d1953e92cfdfb05d8ef20de1a8b30">Damn omnivore</h2>

<p>Last week Green Ruby was sent with a delay. For some obscure reason my
publication was blocked by <a href="http://mailchimp.com/omnivore/">Omnivore</a> the automated fraud detection system
from Mailchimp. My account was instantly blocked and it was pending a human
review. Of course the human review made it clear that the publication was
clean but it took 2 days and I still don&rsquo;t know why this omnivore beast went
mad at me.</p>

<p>They declare it&rsquo;s getting smarter everyday, but really, we are still safe. The
reign of the intelligent computer over the human species is not close yet.</p>

<h2 id="make-it-static:f97d1953e92cfdfb05d8ef20de1a8b30">Make it static</h2>

<p>Dynamic websites are great. But that&rsquo;s a long time I wonder about the
trade-off. If you update your blog every day, and have 500 visits, your
dynamic setup is useful when you edit, and it&rsquo;s a cost for each visitor. There
are so many web applications that could be more clever about it. Especially
that now the computation is going more and more client side.</p>

<p>Static pages have a really unbeatable response time, their security is really
reliable, they are low dependencies and easy to deploy with a rsync.</p>

<p>When I get to think about making a new website, I always ask myself if it&rsquo;s an
application or a website. For sure some kind of applications are computation
intensive. Making it all dynamic could make sense. But frankly, if it&rsquo;s a
website, it can have some fancy dynamic features without a huge dynamic setup.</p>

<p>I have seen so many websites made with php, mysql, 5 tables and 20 entries in
each. Such site should have pre-generated content, data available as static
json files, as a bit of js to make the magic happen. If there is a lot of
data, fine, an API server makes sense.</p>

<p>So next time you gotta prepare a website, ask yourself how easy it could be to
generate it and use tools like <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>. Or you can even
handle things with custom rake tasks (<a href="https://github.com/greenruby/grn-static/blob/master/lib/builder.rb#L87">like I do for Green Ruby website</a>),
that&rsquo;s not that hard. It&rsquo;s a matter of cyberspace ecology.</p>
