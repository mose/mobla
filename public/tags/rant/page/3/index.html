<h2 id="greenruby-irl-and-remote-meetup:cb0f8bc8c9864210771f601228a96c48">GreenRuby IRL and Remote meetup</h2>

<p>Last week I posted a link about <a href="http://remotemeetup.com/">Remote Meetups</a>, but, as it sometimes
happens, it didn&rsquo;t stop there. The basic principle was appealing to me. It&rsquo;s
true that we don&rsquo;t all live in the Bay area or in New York. Having high
quality speakers in meetups is hard when you live in a small city or a remote
country. And this is exactly what that initiative tries to address.</p>

<p>So I jumped in and had some talk with Franze. The result is that the GreenRuby
meetup we will have this friday will also be remote. Some people will <a href="http://greenruby.kktix.cc/events/grg-001">attend
physically</a>, some people will <a href="https://www.bigmarker.com/remote-meetup/Green-Ruby-Meetup-001">come virtually</a> using the
<a href="https://www.bigmarker.com/communities/remote-meetup">Bigmarker</a> platform on the RemoteMeetup account.</p>

<p>Those events usually are based on a format including a presentation followed
by interactions. My plan is to go nuts and try a full-social format, with no
presentation at all, jumping directly to the interactions. It&rsquo;s going to be
highly experimental and may lead to failure, but it certainly won&rsquo;t kill any
kitten in the process so I think we are safe.</p>

<p>The mix between physical and remote event is the challenging part. We may try
the <a href="https://bigmarker.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203332009-Attending-and-Hosting-Webinars">usage of mobile phones</a> to make local people become remote
participants (but it seems to be IOs only for now). I will get an iPad ready
for easier floating access, that can be fun.</p>

<p>You are welcome to join, either online or irl. I heard <a href="https://gandi.net">Gandi</a>, the
physical host and my employer, is going to fill up the fridge with hundred of
various beverages and won&rsquo;t mind us to help reduce that quantity.</p>

<p>Recently Gandi moved to a much bigger office in Neihu, Taipei. And I got
permission to use the space to organize events. We got a great space, sound
system with wireless mikes, a beamer for presentations. So, if you are in
Taipei, feel free to <a href="http://greenruby.kktix.cc/events/grg-001">join us on wednesday next week</a>.  I will try to
make it a remote meetup, and give more details next week.</p>

<h2 id="it-s-the-fault-of-the-bike:5828fd4de747cabcdfd7abec8b5b8468">It&rsquo;s the fault of the bike</h2>

<p>Well, in the last two weeks I get short in links gathered on our slack pinned
list. Usually I&rsquo;m reading various RSS feeds while commuting, and I post them
on slack, for later one pinning them. Then I have a script in go that will
grab all the pinned url, and remove the pins at the moment I use and check
them for inclusion in the publication.</p>

<p>But 2 weeks ago, I decided to change my habits and go to the office by bike.
It&rsquo;s a 30 minutes ride, and it&rsquo;s very good. But then hare we are: no no way to
check RSS on the phone. I&rsquo;m going to need to find another trick. Because I
won&rsquo;t quit the biking.</p>

<h2 id="nanoservices:037dc3f5d87e2e1488613d254aa9c717">Nanoservices</h2>

<p>That link to <a href="http://shoutcloud.io">Shoutcloud</a> made me laugh and then made me think.
It&rsquo;s not the first time I see some micro-service publicly available. 2 years
ago there was some talk about <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/05/nano-services">nano-services as an antipattern</a>.
But when you push the logic a little further, and at a very large scale, maybe
it&rsquo;s a projection of what the future will be.</p>

<p>Imagine our software totally destructured, calling functions taht are stored
on the net, using some load balanced worldwide environment. We already do that
with CDNs. Javascript next Modules proposals will go in that direction as
well. But what is a method call in a program that we know today could become a
service call of an external globally available function.</p>

<p>After all we always write the same code. How many time did you write a regexp
for <a href="http://emailregex.com/">email pattern validation</a>? The RFC 822 and 5322 are nasties,
yeah. If we had no latency consideration, I would gladly delegate various
pieces of code to a specialized service. But latency, is it really an issue
now? We work more and more with async code, with queues and messages. What
seems heretic for our current legacy standards would not seem that foolish in
a slightly different context.</p>

<p>So technically, I suppose nanoservices are a possible future. I even think
it&rsquo;s a requirement for scaling any kind of agent-based architecture. Machine
learning will be much better off by just registering maps to knowledge than
knowledge itself. But I wonder about the economical side of things. The old
capitalist market economy is already stretching its reach far beyond its
original statement with immaterial economy. The totally destructured
immaterial one will certainly propose an interesting challenge.</p>

<h2 id="go-again:16e33c9f1a3f0ada66ffc6cd616986d9">Go again</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s years that I&rsquo;m trying to do something real with go. I mean, it is a
very attractive language with quite a special workflow and toolbox. From time
to time I write some small script for keeping contact with that language. Last
week I made <a href="https://github.com/greenruby/slackpin/blob/master/pins.go">this one</a> to list links pinned in our Greenruby
slackroom to prepare the letter, So I can open them all at once to check them
in my browser. With time passing, seems that Go now has a really complete
collection of libraries for a lot of usages. I think I will have push a little
the slack api soon, and maybe do some real go coding.</p>

<h2 id="aprils-lame-fools:04ce5954ad800128a33af7a0330e1817">Aprils lame fools</h2>

<p>I think there is nothing I hate more than pranks. It&rsquo;s just another way to
bully someone else. Even innocent pranks are having victims. Single out the
one that fall for it to make laugh the ones that don&rsquo;t. Well, I may very well
be a boring fellow. Or it&rsquo;s just that, working so much with information
management, any perversion of it seems off.</p>

<p>And then on april fools day, so much goes wrong. The net becomes unreliable.
So lame. But I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s the reason there are not that many news
articles this week.</p>

<h2 id="kik-the-fuss:2a9c5ad01254a64b6911e087d156ed08">kik the fuss</h2>

<p>There have been some noise last week about npm, coming from <a href="https://medium.com/@azerbike/i-ve-just-liberated-my-modules-9045c06be67c#.evxywifiu">that
article</a>. It merely revealed that various open source
organization are privately held by some individuals and they can either be
pressured or take weird decisions. Honestly I consider this incident
anecdotal. It&rsquo;s not the first time such thing happens. One guy just happened
to be very vocal and pissed off about it.</p>

<p>And it carried various threads of discussion on Twitter and elsewhere, in a
huge controversy. There were many points raised. NPM has thousands and
thousands of packages, and many of them are just a few lines of utility
library, so it was a good occasion for some to point out that you should
reduce your number of dependencies. Others pointed out that namespacing could
help prevent such situation, like it&rsquo;s done in docker or in go (having
username/somelib instead of somelib) following the github convention.</p>

<p>All in all, it appears that open source is gaining its traction from being
free of any legal duty. Or at least there is no formal contracting, no
by-laws, on committees or advisors. People do how they feel in the limits of
some very simple basic licensing rules. Some organization provide a more
structured legal asset but they usually are on the side and purposed for
channeling money management, not necessarily patents and intellectual
property.</p>

<p>My opinion is that this kind of friction between businesses and open source is
going to happen more and more. But I wonder how it&rsquo;s going to turn out.</p>

<h2 id="no-rant-this-week:db8cdf835bd9f38d6f3130fd681dae2e">No rant this week</h2>

<p>Well it&rsquo;s not the first time. I just don&rsquo;t feel inspired. So I better shut up
rather than writing useless rant. It&rsquo;s so easy to fill up space with
meaningless content. But I&rsquo;m not doing that ever. I only speak out when I have
something to say. And yes, I&rsquo;m very comfortable to contradict myself by
writing a useless rant. This is the beauty of the human being: our ability to
abstract makes possible all sort of paradoxes. Wait, is it related to
abstractions? hmm, This is a great topic for my day-dreaming in the subway.
Oh, damn I&rsquo;m late. Cya all and have a good week.</p>

<h2 id="the-adwar:debed575b05619529113f9bc1dd797c9">the Adwar</h2>

<p>This week I got 2 links that explore both sides of the adwar. The war on
advertisement exists on the web since it became popular enough to attract
advertisers. <a href="https://github.com/fivefilters/block-ads/wiki/There-are-no-acceptable-ads">There are no acceptable ads</a> takes the side of the users,
while <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/03/never-ending-story-ad-blockers">A Never-Ending Story On Ad-Blockers</a> seems to defend and
advise the publishers.</p>

<p>Some media already have blocked the blockers. It&rsquo;s forbidden to escape ads?
This position may appear not to be sustainable. And pushing towards content
sponsoring could have really bad ill effects on the long term. Is there any
escape? Honestly I have to say that I&rsquo;m partial in that debate. I don&rsquo;t like
ads on what I read, and I don&rsquo;t like ads on what I publish. I even go edit my
/etc/hosts with some custom domains to resolve to 127.0.0.1 sometimes.</p>

<p>So it there was to take sides, I would say advertiser, go to hell. But I&rsquo;m a
realist. They won&rsquo;t go away. We live in a society where shit has to be bought.
Yes even if you don&rsquo;t need it. Otherwise the system will collapse. That&rsquo;s how
things are. I get some crazy dreams about some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income">basic income</a>
system, currently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_around_the_world">in experiment</a> in various places over the
globe. Such setup would defeat part of this situation, even if it would have
border effects that are unpredictable. But that would not change much for the
big corpo, it would only save the small people. Hmm. Sounds good enough to me,
I won&rsquo;t lie.</p>

<h2 id="about-tests-and-documentation:329bfb00efd0c1fb86f4a0195e637cef">About tests and documentation</h2>

<p>This aspect of development, called Documentation, is the source of various
frustrations. It&rsquo;s hard to get do it, but why? My feeling is that it&rsquo;s like
testing. When you begin your craft as a coder, all what matters is the code.
It&rsquo;s only after some iterations that some non-code aspects come back bite you
in the neck. Like, huho, now that I need to refactor, I really should use
something that tells me if all still works. Tests become an early necessity to
anyone who knows that kind of truth. If you wait until the end of a coding
cycle to write those, the task is huge and it cuts you from your productivity
cycle. Write them early, along the flow, is way easier.</p>

<p>So I think documentation follows the same pattern. So many software projects
are badly documented because this aspect is postponed until it&rsquo;s needed. Means
at release stage. In early stages, you work on a prototype and you don&rsquo;t need
to explain how things work or are supposed to work. And when it&rsquo;s released,
there is usually some other task waiting and it&rsquo;s hard to stop everything to
get back and document things properly. It may be a flaw in the agile process,
but it may also be a feature: if you don&rsquo;t document along the way, you won&rsquo;t
document much.</p>

<p>Personally I try to consider the documentation of any of the source code I
write as one of the first tasks. There are various tricks that can help in
that perspective, like <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html">readme-driven development</a>, or including the doc
inside the code with <a href="http://yardoc.org/">yarddoc</a> or <a href="http://ilyabylich.svbtle.com/apipie-amazing-tool-for-documenting-your-rails-api">apipie</a>, or coupling
documentation with tests with <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/zipmark/rspec-api-documentation/docs/generate-html-documentation-from-test-examples">rspec</a> or <a href="https://github.com/zipmark/rspec_api_documentation">RSpec API Doc
Generator</a>. But honestly I prefer edited documentation that can follow
a structure that is thought as documentation rather than merely an automated
output of some code.</p>

<p>There are various tools to organize edited documentation, like
<a href="https://readthedocs.org/">ReadTheDoc</a> which is in python. Another project appeared last week from
the guys at Pluralsight named <a href="http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/faq/">hack.guide()</a>. That&rsquo;s a community project
but actually being totally open sourced, I was thinking the <a href="https://github.com/pluralsight/guides-cms">documentation
building CMS</a> they made could pretty much fill the gap of a
light-weight RTD, with the benefits of having a UI for editors. Too bad we
don&rsquo;t have anything like this in ruby (or do we?).</p>
