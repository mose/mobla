## Is Facebook the new NPM?

This week there is a lot of noise in the JS ecosystem, on various trends. But
the most noticeable is about [Yarn][yarn]. Yet another package manager for js,
that states it opens a war against NPM (in soft terms but clearly enough). The
[long post from Facebook][yarnf] about it demonstrates a clear effort to push
things forward about NPM shortcomings. The reaction on [hacker news][hnyarn]
is pretty verbose.

It provoked a public [response from NPM][npmyarn] to try to explain that, nop,
it's not a war. But I keep feeling that Facebook is slowly taking over another
piece of the javascript world. For now, it doesn't seem harmful at all, but my
instinct lights a various number of warning bonfires.

But for real, it was more than time that the supremacy of NPM was questioned.
It has a lot of flaws and the number of posts about this event proves that the
community was kind of waiting for something like this to happen. Like this
[cheatsheet][yarncheat], various articles like [this one][articleyarn], this
enthusiastic post from [Yehuda Kats][yarnyehuda]. But [not everybody is happy][yarnmore]
about how things are done.

Personally, I like the technical direction it takes. But I hope that like
io.js went back to node.js, it will eventually merge back to NPM, really. But
I have the feeling it is not going to happen.
