<h2 id="the-side-effects-of-recruitment:849328e7dfc904a2b6d861e0036f0df4">The side effects of recruitment</h2>

<p>Recently I had to look for a new devops for our team. I have been handling
technical recruitment at many occasions, and each time I have to explain my
colleagues that I have a special process. The fact is, the technical sphere is
a small one, we are all linked, more or less, to a community. Well, in my
case, I always have had to recruit people in companies that were hiring the
kind of people that commit on github, have some kind of community activity, at
least. I guess that in huge companies where people are just a set of
checkboxes, things go a bit differently.</p>

<p>But anyways, in my case, and probably in the case of all recruiters in modern
and small businesses, it&rsquo;s not all about checkboxes and profiles. It&rsquo;s about
personality, compatibility, and mindset. So when I first get a contact with a
candidate, I invite him (or much more rarely, her), to a chat online,
preferably on irc or whatever real-time discussion media is more fit (for a
linux geek, if you can&rsquo;t go on irc, then there is a problem).</p>

<p>I noticed that during my past sessions of recruitment, I established contacts
with very interesting people. By having an unformal discussion online, just
chit-chating of what work we do and what we did before, it&rsquo;s kind of easy to
get an idea of what is the kind of relationship you will have with your
potential future colleague. But beyond that, it&rsquo;s all about making things
personal. We are all unique. It cannot be computed, scripted, engineered in a
way that non-technical people would be successful conducting that process. It
takes a geek to recognize another geek.</p>

<p>At Gandi of course we have a HR person. But she usually appears at the very
end of the process and not at the beginning. The peers are going to evaluate
candidates, make their mind to see if they want to spend days and days
collaborating with them. It matches with my way to do things, fortunately. If
I have any doubt of the technical abilities on someone, I don&rsquo;t do stupid
technical tests, I try to find other people that know the candidate and get
third party feedback. If not, then I try to use a meetup in a community
related to the speciality in question, so we can discuss and be around other
people where some tangent discussion can happen.</p>

<p>At the end, if all goes well, then the candidate is going to enter the more
formal whatever the company uses as a recruitment flow. But that&rsquo;s merely a
formality. And after 20 years building up teams and recruiting people, I can
affirm that instinct always wins, in my case. If I smell anything fishy in an
unformal context, there is going to be problems. Well, the process is never
perfect, it also can smell ok but stink after 3 months, too.</p>

<p>But the thing is that having those chats online with peers is pretty
interesting. I learn a lot about how other companies work, how they handle
their management, what kind of work conditions they have. Just because it&rsquo;s
part of the contact process. So I&rsquo;m not really in hurry to make a final
decision because, to be honest, I just enjoy those contacts.</p>

<p>It certainly takes some time, I can&rsquo;t be in constant recruitment, but from
time to time, it&rsquo;s very valuable. And not only for the effect of recruiting
someone. It creates bonds with the industry, with people, with communities.</p>

<h2 id="noobs-rule-the-planet:fb906e6159a53dc43f4de9d255805b75">Noobs rule the planet</h2>

<p>There is something that I always did in my career managing internet tools. I
volunteer helping non-technical people to get a presence online, build up
communities and such things. But I have to confess, this comes with a price. A
price on your nerves when you realize that easy obvious things that you take
for granted are actually not clear at all by the average Joe.</p>

<p>Yeah sure they can post of facebook. For many of them, it&rsquo;s pretty much all
what internet means. But for the real things, they have no clue what they are
doing. Talk about the merits of a chaos money to test your infrastructure.
Well, the man on the street is pretty much the best you can get when it comes
to chaos testing your design and workflow.</p>

<p>But whatever infuriating it can be, it&rsquo;s a great thing to keep in mind. People
have no clue what they are doing. They don&rsquo;t know what an url is. They think
smileys are fun. They feel writing all in capitals is just a detail. When some
popup appears they consider it&rsquo;s all broken and there is no need to read
what&rsquo;s written on it because anyways that&rsquo;s over their heads.</p>

<p>So, when you design your applications, you may be lucky enough to face an
educated population. But in many cases, you may not. Take it in account. Make
things over-explicit and use images to bypass the inability of the modern
average people to read anything that is more than a sentence of 5 words.</p>

<p>Go volunteer to help your fellow neighbors in your local non-tech communities.
It&rsquo;s hard, but it helps keep in touch with the reality.</p>

<p>And above all, keep patience. It&rsquo;s not their fault. There has never been any
economical incentive to educate users. The shortest path is always the best
path. So for sure, you should make things easy. But if you get any occasion to
provide your users some education, it&rsquo;s never going to be on your spec sheets.
You can do it as a natural thing to do. Add optional text to explain why
things are the way they are. Few will read it, but they will learn from it.</p>

<h2 id="letter-process-and-numbers:83d19966174428ef802df4954f70730e">Letter process and numbers</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s a few weeks now that we are getting organized better, with Xenor and
Tysliu, on the preparation of this newsletter. The guys are now putting more
attention to the news gathering and preformatting the <a href="https://github.com/greenruby/grn-static/blob/master/newsletters/grn.yml">yaml source file</a>
that I use to generate the letter and the website. After
some time of practice, it is much better for me, as now I don&rsquo;t spend 5 hours
each sunday anymore and I can manage the publication process in less than 2
hours. I still gather some extra links after the editors push their
contributions. Then I verify the links, the categories, edit the comments
sometimes, add dots at the ends of line, such tiny things. A huge thanks to
Xenor and Tysliu!</p>

<p>Now we have 1312 subscribers to the newsletter. Plus an unknown number of RSS
subscribers, maybe around 200. We get 250 visits per day on the website
(according to webalizer), and most of them come from rss readers of many
sorts. As the mailchimp is still free until we reach 2000, there is some
margin. When we reach 1600 I think I swill begin a cleaning campaign, to help
people that actually don&rsquo;t read the letter to unsubscribe. I kind of like the
idea of throwing accounts away. Usually in web business, an account is an
asset and they are never thrown away. There is so much to be told about
numbers, and their reality, in our industry.</p>

<p>But the reality about numbers is usually the consequence of the over
simplification required by marketeers. Things are never so simple as just a
single number. The technicians among us are always in pain when we need to
provide numbers, because they come with a strict definition of what they
count, and that definition is never respected by the people that just want to
use the number and put a sexy label on it. When we say &lsquo;registered accounts&rsquo;
they say &lsquo;users&rsquo;. Do you see the difference? Damn, I hate that system that
forces salesmen to become a liars.</p>

<h2 id="rfid-world:662331cbc9868114293fb05e69319f30">RFID world</h2>

<p>They begin to appear everywhere. I saw mine first on my passport, then I just
got my new credit card and it has one in it. Those things are nice if you
consider them naively. But the fact is that they are flawed and insecure. We
carry around more and more of those items that can be read at a proximity by
specially crafter devices. Gosh, did they not learn already from the ingenuity
of our kids?</p>

<p>There have been myths in science fiction about human implanted with chips.
Well, our phones for a while have been providing the same features. Call me
paranoid, but I just don&rsquo;t like the feeling. And I also don&rsquo;t like not having
any choice about it. Hopefully we can still <a href="https://youtu.be/E_f5oRwaQew">disable the credit cards RFID</a>,
<a href="https://youtu.be/BEyRfjeE6ac">craft some pockets</a> to put our passport in
it, or buy some <a href="https://youtu.be/MhW-QLhmoVw">faraday pockets</a>.</p>

<p>If you pay attention, you can find or hear about phone apps called &lsquo;electronic
pickpocket apps&rsquo;. This choice of a name if so relevant to the situation. Note
that NFC, included in more and more phones, is a subcategory of RFID, operates
in much smaller range (10 cm). But basic RFID tags can be detected beyond 100
meters with proper antennas.</p>

<p>We talk about the Internet of Things. Sounds sexy. But clearly, we only are
one of the Things of that Internet. Without any implant, just by carrying
around passport and credit cards. Or by working at a company that uses that
technology for <a href="http://www.wavetrend.net/personnel-tracking.php">staff monitoring</a>. I don&rsquo;t know about you,
but for me, it&rsquo;s scary as hell.</p>

<h2 id="welcome-jessie:d9f4d66fbdcd986833b23a4199ad62c2">Welcome Jessie</h2>

<p>Ok, right. Maybe you don&rsquo;t care, but this saturday <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie">Jessie</a> was
officially released. It&rsquo;s the next stable version of debian, version 8.0, and
it&rsquo;s great that it finally got out. Debian release cycles are certainly not as
fast as Ubuntu, but the stuff in there is more stable. And well, in my
personal case, I work in a place where everything is in debian wheezy and can
now finally get upgraded.</p>

<p>Actually I have been using Ubuntu on my desktop for some time. The reason was
that I wanted to be able to help people to transition to linux, without being
overloaded with support. So I had to know how ubuntu work. But last year I
switched back to the original debian and I have been pretty happy about that.
There is less cruft and opinionated choices (no freaking unity as a default
window manager). And it&rsquo;s pretty straightfoward in the install process. I
suspect even non-techies could give it a try (I know some that did).</p>

<h2 id="state-surveillance-in-france:2e160e3cd77d85bf5cb357e6e45cadd1">State surveillance in France</h2>

<p>What happened this week in France is quite shocking. How can they be so long
to make useful laws and so quick to pass harmful ones? Well the move began in
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/11/french-officials-internet-users-real-time-law">December last year</a>. Some call it a French Patriot act. This
is not the first time there is an attempt from French government to enforce
stronger control on the internet. The pressure of lobbies and media industries
have been pushing hard to preserve their interests.</p>

<p>But this time, it&rsquo;s just about copying the NSA, and get legal requirement for
service providers to host the black boxes. Seems that the Snowden revelations
gave the lawmakers some ideas. The impact is not anecdotal in the French
society. Some service providers announce they will leave the country like
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/11/french-officials-internet-users-real-time-law">Altern</a> (French), others <a href="http://blogs.mediapart.fr/blog/laurent-chemla/170415/lettre-ceux-qui-sen-foutent">call to action</a> (French). Both
Valentin and Laurent are long time activists in the French landscape. I know
them for a while. Funny how things turn out, I&rsquo;m now working in the company
they founded in 99 (and passed hands in 2005).</p>

<p>But all this makes me think that we are facing a technicality. The real thing
is systemic. It seems that we failed, as a civilization, to regain control
over our systems. The course of evolution is going to lead to more control to
the machines, more dependence on the computerized information. Up to a point
where our insignificance as human being will become really obvious.</p>

<p>We, as small makers of this computerized universe, should have some part of
responsibility. Is there a way that we can bend the course of history by the
small choices we make? Can we not take decisions in regard of how to implement
solutions, in a way that we can preserve a margin of freedom and respect for
the human species? I&rsquo;m not sure, at this point, there is anything we can do.
But if we don&rsquo;t try, we will never know. Think about it. You build systems.
You shape the world. Your choice matters.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-inheritance-simulation:a9a546e37849f6a570839940ccf98c98">Multiple inheritance simulation</h2>

<p>This is a bit twisted. In ruby, as you know, you cannot use multiple
inheritance. But the flexibility of the language, especially the
metaprogramming aspect, opens the door for some cheating. Check out
<a href="https://gist.github.com/capitalist/473543b7ea24d461d030">this code</a>, it tricks it by declaring the first class as the super
class and the remaining classes as modules included in that super class.
Pretty acrobatic and elegant, imho.</p>

<h2 id="about-vaping:a9a546e37849f6a570839940ccf98c98">About vaping</h2>

<p>Well this has been my burden for 30 years, and I&rsquo;m not proud of it. But last
week it finally ended. I quit smoking. But this was kindof a trick, as it was
made possible by switching to <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5-facts-that-everyone-gets-wrong-about-vaping-1659938937">vaping</a>. It certainly doesn&rsquo;t solve the
nicotine addiction issue, but I&rsquo;m very happy with this move and hopeful for a
gradual freedom.</p>

<p>I also found out that this vaping practice is very geeky. The hardware part is
quite elaborate, vaping devices are really neat piece of work, there are a
bunch of vendors. The liquidware is also quite a subject of hacking.
Technically it&rsquo;s not that hard to do it yourself. Not surprising that I
discovered this vaping practice in geeks circles.</p>

<h2 id="green-ruby-new-generation:e04937da80b109c53cab9bf63b0a6b99">Green Ruby New Generation</h2>

<p>We had this week a very productive meeting with xenor and tysliu in our
preferred coffee shop. I explained more in detail my workflow and my quality
criterias. So now they can feed the links section and become the major editors
of Green Ruby. I Still keep the role of the publisher. I get their links, I
clean up stuff, verify freshness and reachability, remove superlatives, fix
category if needed.</p>

<p>Special thanks a lot to Xenor and Tysliu (aka. Simon). Now they do the heavy
lifting and they are the reason why Green Ruby is still in your mailbox every
week.</p>

<h2 id="drones-and-makers:84bb7b31097e7dff868fbef479daafb5">Drones and makers</h2>

<p>This is now obvious. We are going to get invaded by drones. Of course we will
pretend we control them, for a while. But I can bet it&rsquo;s not going to stand
too long. Their autonomy is a competitive factor, and, in our current society,
competitive is the Darwinian selective factor. It can be a bit scary.</p>

<p>But on another hand, when we geeks look at those things with our (never-aging)
kids eyes, we see fun toys. Look at the <a href="http://www.bgobeyond.co.uk/">B Flying car</a>. We can
<a href="http://diydrones.com/">do them ourselves</a>. Like we were able to tinker with the first computers, the
first radio stations. But now we have 3D printing. Yet not that affordable,
but it seems to get better. There is also that creepy <a href="http://the3doodler.com/">3Doodler</a>
thingie, and various other new techniques.</p>

<p>Maybe the Makers movement is the hope for humanity. Reclaim the daily small
things! Check that <a href="http://www.instructables.com/">instructable</a> website it&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Well yeah this all has nothing to do with webdev. Except from the fact that
open standards made possible to people like me to do the web myself. After a
time, it became a professional activity. Will we get professional makers in
the future and see a revival of craftsmanship? I really wonder.</p>

<h2 id="time-to-upgrade:d4567cfa55308712270d1f5b73098130">Time to upgrade</h2>

<p>This is a long time I plan to re-engineer the way Green Ruby is produced. Last
week I told Xenor and Simon I was thinking about giving it a break. I&rsquo;m not
that much anymore in the flow. Now my days are full ops and not that much dev.
But the guys didn&rsquo;t want to let me stop.</p>

<p>So we are going to organize things a little differently. Xenor and Simon,
which are full time rails developers, are going to handle the content more
extensively, and I will just manage the publication, plus some devops links.
So we need to get some tools ready to handle that new flow. Maybe, the time it
gets ready, we will take some time off. Maybe not.</p>

<p>What I wish is to have a way to let more people jump in, too. Maybe we will
get inspiration in how <a href="http://thechangelog.com/trello-as-a-cms/">the changelog</a> manages their news
flow. They based it on a <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> and it&rsquo;s quite clever. By chance I
explored the trello API recently and I can tell it&rsquo;s really good, very
suitable for custom automation.</p>

<p>This week, I will play lazy on the podcasts. I don&rsquo;t think they are that much
interesting anyways, and all that copy-pasting is exhausting. When some
podcasts stands out of the crowd, I will rather feature it in this rant.</p>
