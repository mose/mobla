      <description>Great occasion to kick thunderbird byebye and spend some time on configuring my mutt to make it real again, after 6 years of click-click for mail. I was a mutt user for a very long time, and my pause for trying a GUI mail client just had to have an end. But the mail has clearly become something else now. Actually much more volume, but much more automated things, and news feeds.</description>

      <description>This week-end they changed time in France. As I work with those guys to cover the watching of servers, then I need to change time too. This is totally lame. In the context of largely distributed teams, DST is heresy. It happens in the US too, but not even at the same time. Man I hate DST. I&amp;rsquo;m happy we don&amp;rsquo;t have that in Taiwan.
Thunderbird sucks too Despite the respect I have for mozilla products and for their efforts toward the community, I have to say that I have been using thunderbird for a while and I don&amp;rsquo;t like it.</description>
