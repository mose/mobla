We host some dev boxes on Digitalocean, and I tried varioous CLI because I like to stay in the console. Recently I was pretty happy to find Tugboat, as it saves default droplet size, region and image, and convers the whole API. Its fuzzy droplet name matching also can find great usage.

The only problem it has, is its counter-intuitive damn name (I forgot how to launch it 2 hours after using it the first time haha).
