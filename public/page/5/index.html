<h2 id="working-abroad:a0091e7eb1dfeca477447c7e0b2e6425">Working abroad</h2>

<p>Our craft as webdev is clearly in huge demand. This provides an opportunity
for us to travel abroad, discover new cultures, widen our horizon. When I went
to live in Taiwan, I was not worried about finding a job. But when hunting for
a job abroad it can be tricky to find companies that will sponsor a visa, a
work permit, or whatever legal requirement is involved in each countries.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what the new initiative called <a href="http://techmeabroad.com">TechMeAbroad</a> aims to fix, by
listing only job opportunities for which a work permit is sponsored. As
<a href="http://jbarbier42.tumblr.com/post/112155851079/introducing-techmeabroad">Julien Barbier explains</a>, it will launch in march, and if you know of any
job offers that includes a visa or such thing, please let him know (or send it
to me I will pass it along), so we can feed that platform with some real data
quickly.</p>

<h2 id="so-long-ruby-1-9:a0091e7eb1dfeca477447c7e0b2e6425">So long ruby 1.9</h2>

<p>As planned, it&rsquo;s now time to say <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2015/02/23/support-for-ruby-1-9-3-has-ended/">byebye to ruby 1.9.3</a>. But there is still
so many old version of ruby in the wild. In debian squeeze, you gotta use 1.8.
In wheezy, you have 1.9. And there are still many servers that will refuse to
upgrade.</p>

<h2 id="pick-your-hero:a0091e7eb1dfeca477447c7e0b2e6425">Pick your hero</h2>

<p>The registration for <a href="http://rubyheroes.com/">Ruby Heroes 2015</a> is now open. Go vote for your
favorite ruby influential dev. You have until <a href="http://railsconf.com/">railsconf</a> that will happen
in april, in Atlanta this year.</p>

<h2 id="happy-year-of-the-goat:a9be2ef830fd7cbccc6ae0de53135b81">Happy year of the Goat</h2>

<p>Here it was Chinese New Year this week. A good occasion for those who are not
familiar with chinese state of the web to read about its <a href="http://designbeep.com/2015/02/20/free-download-chinese-new-year-icon-pack-50-icons/">web design trends 2015</a>.
This article is pretty deep and reflects accurately how China uses
its connectivity.</p>

<p>So, xin nian kuai le, and of course, gong xi fa cai. And if you need related
icons, <a href="http://designbeep.com/2015/02/20/free-download-chinese-new-year-icon-pack-50-icons/">here are some</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hello-in-firefox:a9be2ef830fd7cbccc6ae0de53135b81">Hello in Firefox</h2>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;m working from Taiwan with a French company, I was have been
searching for a decent solution for video conferencing. Because skype and
google-hangouts are just not things I like to use. I found out that new
versions of firefox include by default a one to one webrtc feature, named
<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-hello-video-and-voice-conversations-online">Hello</a>. It works pretty nicely. I also tried out <a href="https://glideroom.com/">Glideroom</a> and
<a href="https://hu.tt/">Hutt</a>. There are also heavier solutions that I tried in the past like the
<a href="http://bigbluebutton.org/">big blue button</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately some dude in the ops team pointed out that webrtc was <a href="https://blog.ipvanish.com/webrtc-security-hole-leaks-real-ip-addresses/">not
secure</a>, so it&rsquo;s not likely to become a standard for us. Hrum, well, that&rsquo;s
debatable how proprietary solutions are more secure. There is no way to get it
figured out. Anyways Webrtc became a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-webrtc-20150210/">w3c standard</a> recently, and the
section 12, named security, says: TBD. Let&rsquo;s hope it will be done properly.</p>

<p>Any of you have some first hand experience with any alternative video
conference system, please send me a mail with your feedback.</p>

<h2 id="damn-omnivore:f97d1953e92cfdfb05d8ef20de1a8b30">Damn omnivore</h2>

<p>Last week Green Ruby was sent with a delay. For some obscure reason my
publication was blocked by <a href="http://mailchimp.com/omnivore/">Omnivore</a> the automated fraud detection system
from Mailchimp. My account was instantly blocked and it was pending a human
review. Of course the human review made it clear that the publication was
clean but it took 2 days and I still don&rsquo;t know why this omnivore beast went
mad at me.</p>

<p>They declare it&rsquo;s getting smarter everyday, but really, we are still safe. The
reign of the intelligent computer over the human species is not close yet.</p>

<h2 id="make-it-static:f97d1953e92cfdfb05d8ef20de1a8b30">Make it static</h2>

<p>Dynamic websites are great. But that&rsquo;s a long time I wonder about the
trade-off. If you update your blog every day, and have 500 visits, your
dynamic setup is useful when you edit, and it&rsquo;s a cost for each visitor. There
are so many web applications that could be more clever about it. Especially
that now the computation is going more and more client side.</p>

<p>Static pages have a really unbeatable response time, their security is really
reliable, they are low dependencies and easy to deploy with a rsync.</p>

<p>When I get to think about making a new website, I always ask myself if it&rsquo;s an
application or a website. For sure some kind of applications are computation
intensive. Making it all dynamic could make sense. But frankly, if it&rsquo;s a
website, it can have some fancy dynamic features without a huge dynamic setup.</p>

<p>I have seen so many websites made with php, mysql, 5 tables and 20 entries in
each. Such site should have pre-generated content, data available as static
json files, as a bit of js to make the magic happen. If there is a lot of
data, fine, an API server makes sense.</p>

<p>So next time you gotta prepare a website, ask yourself how easy it could be to
generate it and use tools like <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>. Or you can even
handle things with custom rake tasks (<a href="https://github.com/greenruby/grn-static/blob/master/lib/builder.rb#L87">like I do for Green Ruby website</a>),
that&rsquo;s not that hard. It&rsquo;s a matter of cyberspace ecology.</p>

<h2 id="ghost:fba0bb1f68d1414085590cced7805ffa">Ghost</h2>

<p>You certainly heard about it, this week there was a new huge Linux
<a href="http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/01/27/9">vulnerability on glibc</a> revealed. Actually it was leaked by a stupid
communication agency few hours before it should have been announced. When such
big bug is discovered usually there is a small period of time where the news
spread into some limited circles. They keep it embargoed until major distro
vendors get patched packages ready. Well, it didn&rsquo;t go that well this time.</p>

<p>This vulnerability is pretty nasty even if less obvious to exploit than
Heartbleed or shellshock, it&rsquo;s probably in the same category. If you manage
servers that are vulnerable (LTS and stable, less up to date versions,
mostly), you better upgrade asap. When a bug gets its own name (this one is
called Ghost), it seems to be the sign it requires immediate attention. How
long is this trick going to work?</p>

<p>And, as we talk about security, Hipchat users should read this (unnamed)
<a href="https://blog.hipchat.com/2015/02/01/hipchat-security-notice-and-password-reset/">security notice</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2-years:fba0bb1f68d1414085590cced7805ffa">2 years</h2>

<p>This edition is marking the 2 years anniversary of Green Ruby. For 104 weeks
I&rsquo;ve been sending out this newsletter every week. Last week I had a discussion
with a friend, he was asking me what was my drive, and what was the reason of
my consistency. Well, there are various reasons.</p>

<p>First there is the routine aspect. It&rsquo;s like practicing Taichi or some kind of
exercise. It keeps the mind fresh, and in this context where things change
pretty fast, enforcing a weekly review gave me an overall feeling of symbiosis
with the wave of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>Second is the philosophy of it: this newsletter is a gift. The ruby world is
very business oriented. There is a lot of open source in there but still the
average spirit is based on a market economy. There are of course many
exceptions, I wanted to be one of them, and I believe a gift economy would be
more my thing. You get rich of what you give away, not always individually,
but most definitely collectively. I like that feeling.</p>

<p>Third, this media keeps me in touch with a bunch of my friends. It&rsquo;s like a
beacon that I send to the people I left behind when I left France to go live
in Taiwan. Or people I worked with in my past jobs in Taiwan, even. They don&rsquo;t
often respond to it but I know they can perceive me through this weekly proof
of existence.</p>

<p>Also, there is the support from xenor and more recently from simon, which, by
sending me a few links each weeks, validate the need to keep things going.</p>

<h2 id="trello-and-irc:fba0bb1f68d1414085590cced7805ffa">Trello and irc</h2>

<p>For as long as I remember, I always have been coding irc bots. In so many
languages. I suspect there is some aspect of this that appeals to me. Maybe
the creation of life-like pattern. Anyways, my last bot was of course in ruby,
I called it <a href="https://github.com/mose/cogbot">cogbot</a>, and is based on the great <a href="https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch">cinch</a> framework. It has
been sleepy for a while, since we were not using irc in Faria.</p>

<p>But Gandi is heavy irc user, and our recent experiments on trello gave me an
occasion to get cogbot out of the dust. As a matter of fact <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> has a
really <a href="https://trello.com/docs/">great API</a>, and also supports webhooks. So I added a trello
listener to cogbot, and it was a lot of fun. Maybe next I will add some cards
creation and update features in that bot, but it requires some kind of users
management, which, on an irc bot, is not that trivial to implement.</p>

<h2 id="free-your-code:fba0bb1f68d1414085590cced7805ffa">Free your code</h2>

<p>Do you have a side project? You should! Maybe the code you produce at work can
be generic enough? This is a call for you to consider freeing your code. Open
source community is plentiful but I know as a fact that 90% of the code that
could be shared is not shared.</p>

<p>There is something I noticed in my own code publication. Often in my work
there are constraints of time that lead to trade-offs and code quality is
never as good as I wish it was. By working on side projects, the pace is much
more relaxed and I can spend hours focusing on non productive efforts to make
my code better. Well, this is not to say that side project code is perfect,
but the environment of producing it brings another mindset. And after a while,
the code produced at work gets naturally more insightful because of this extra
practice.</p>

<p>Give it a try, if you happen to have some free time. If you don&rsquo;t have free
time, you&rsquo;re doing something wrong. But that&rsquo;s another story.</p>

<h2 id="more-screens:d021634982f7dcb44b802e2a3d2040a7">More Screens</h2>

<p>Some time ago, when I left Faria, I bought a laptop with a clear purpose. I
wanted to have on linux the same screen experience that I had with the macbook
pro connected to 2 thunderbolts. So I got an <a href="http://www.asus.com/us/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/ASUS_ZENBOOK_UX301LA/">asus UX301L</a> plus 2
<a href="http://accessories.ap.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=au&amp;cs=audhs1&amp;l=en&amp;redirect=1&amp;s=dhs&amp;sku=210-40773">Dell screens U2713HM</a> who supports a 2560x1440 resolution. The laptop in itself
is amazing, dazzling fast, and all worked well with an ubuntu install. This
was not cheap but that was a while I didn&rsquo;t spend anything on hardware.</p>

<p>I struggled a bit to find the proper connectors so I could enable the extra
large resolution on connected screens. I ended up using the mini-hdmi
connector plus a mini-display port converter to DVI for the second one. And
finally it worked last week. I had to <a href="http://www.arunviswanathan.com/node/53">force the resolution in xrandr</a> and
now I have a damn huge double display for a total of 7680x1440. What a blast!</p>

<h2 id="debian-i3wm-and-urxvt:d021634982f7dcb44b802e2a3d2040a7">Debian, i3wm and urxvt</h2>

<p>Well this is an old story. Some time ago I switched from debian + fvwm2/ion to
ubuntu + cinnamon just because I had to know about it. The goal was to be able
to convince my wife (and some other non-techies) to switch to ubuntu. But I
had to know how it worked on a daily basis. And it was a success for most of
it.</p>

<p>2 years ago at Faria I was given a mac. Well, it was good to know a bit more
about it, my mac knowledge was dating from system 6.7 time. But if the
hardware is really good, the OSX experience didn&rsquo;t really satisfy the geek
that was deep inside me.</p>

<p>Then I got back into a team that is deeply attached to pure linux traditions,
when I joined Gandi. I now switched back to a debian jessie with <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3wm</a> on
my work laptop. Wow this feels good to be back to such a rude but flexible
environment. As a matter of fact all went perfectly well and all the tricks I
knew 10 years ago are still very valid.</p>

<p>I also took that occasion to get back into urxvt, for my terminal emulator.
It&rsquo;s a very badly documented over-powerful tool. But when you get the grasp on
it, possibilities are much more satisfying than with gnome-terminal. I&rsquo;m still
working on <a href="https://github.com/mose/rcfiles/blob/master/.Xdefaults">my configuration</a> to match few features that gnome terminal had
(like font resizing, clipboard management). The <a href="https://github.com/mose/rcfiles/blob/master/.urxvt/ext/notification">notification plugin</a>,
combined with <a href="http://knopwob.org/dunst/index.html">dunst</a>, gives amazing results.</p>

<p>It feels good to be back into the cave. To mark this change, I didn&rsquo;t shave
for 3 months so now I&rsquo;m really bearded like the old-fashioned linux bears.
Muhaha!</p>

<p>PS: no worry, I&rsquo;m still fullstack at heart and I still love ruby!</p>

<h2 id="while42:7b1eab39a4e6e397eafd98271e67cb67">While42</h2>

<p>This week I got in contact with Sylvain from <a href="http://while42.org">while42</a>. It&rsquo;s a social
network for french tech engineers, but with a special touch on it. There is no
facebook page or google group. They intentionally decided to be irl-first. For
people that are most likely to be online all the time, this sounds so
therapeutic! So, I decided, with Thomas from Gandi, to setup a Taiwan chapter.
If you want to know more (and are french, engineer, and living in Taipei) just
drop me a mail.</p>

<h2 id="traveling-ruby:7b1eab39a4e6e397eafd98271e67cb67">Traveling ruby</h2>

<p>This is a project from the <a href="http://www.phusion.nl/">Phusion</a> people, called <a href="https://github.com/phusion/traveling-ruby">Traveling ruby</a>.
Its purpose is to make it easy to build auto-sustaining tarballs for ruby
programms, including ruby binary and all gems in it. That way you can publish
a tarball and your customer/user will just launch whatever you put in it. No
need to install ruby or any gems.</p>

<p>I gave it a try yesterday on my <a href="https://github.com/eduvo/zabbix-ruby-client">zabbix-ruby-client</a> gem, and after a few
tweaks (mostly because I wanted to use an unpublished version of my gem), it
all worked pretty fine. Result is a tarball of 8M. Uploaded to the server (an
old squeeze), it just ran the self-contained ruby 2.1.5 with no hassle. It
reminded me a bit of the feeling when you upload a go executable on the
server. Really neat.</p>

<h2 id="palm-control:7b1eab39a4e6e397eafd98271e67cb67">Palm control</h2>

<p>There are tiny things that can change a lot. My recent tiny thing is the palm
control technique. Every sunday when I prepare Green Ruby I do a huge amount
of copy pasting all over the place. Recently I found on a post about keyboard
someone talking about the palm control technique for avoiding the copypaste
fatigue.</p>

<p>Well, you need to have a keyboard that makes it possible. Mine is a <a href="http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/10104">Logitech washable k310</a>.
I already liked its look, and even better, it&rsquo;s perfect for
this palm thing because keys are prominent. Use the palm to push control and
then it&rsquo;s only a matter of hitting c or v with the index. Honestly, it changed
my life!</p>

<h2 id="1000-subscribers:dfd863a69df72c13bbe5f0b5d11c54ce">1000 subscribers</h2>

<p>After the 100th Greenruby last week, we get the 1000th subscriber to the email
newsletter this week. Welcome George :) So for the occasion I refreshed the
<a href="http://mose.cartodb.com/viz/6a4d431e-d6b7-11e3-8757-0e10bcd91c2b/embed_map">subscribers map</a> on cartodb. About half of the subscribers are in the US,
but there is a total of 73 countries represented, which is pretty neat. But
this is based on the ip used for subscribing, so it&rsquo;s not totally accurate.</p>

<h2 id="fighting-logs-pollution:dfd863a69df72c13bbe5f0b5d11c54ce">Fighting logs pollution</h2>

<p>Some time ago, on edition 82, I posted a link to my webalizer stats for the
greenruby website. Fatal mistake, I had referrers stats enabled and I got
somehow listed somewhere. The consequence was a lot of fake traffic with only
purpose to get links listed in my referrers section. After removing this
section from webalizer config, and moving the url, the fake traffic was still
there. Like a blind wave. This was pretty annoying.</p>

<p>So I began to take some drastic measures. Because I didn&rsquo;t have referrers
anymore in my stats, I went to my apache logs (yes it&rsquo;s an old server, still
running apache2) and fire up a:</p>

<pre><code>tail -5000 greenruby.org-access.log | cut -d' ' -f11 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
</code></pre>

<p>This give me a nice view of the recent referrers. Fake ones are easy to
notice. And that the fake traffic was only coming from a handful of ips, so I
just made a few:</p>

<pre><code>iptables -A INPUT -s &lt;ip&gt; -j DROP
</code></pre>

<p>The result was radically efficient. Certainly I had less volume but it&rsquo;s now
much cleaner. But it makes it clear that having clean volume stats for traffic
on your website is not that easy. There are a bunch of fake traffic sources
that you may not suspect.</p>

<h2 id="new-server-soon:dfd863a69df72c13bbe5f0b5d11c54ce">New server soon</h2>

<p>I got a new job 2 month ago at <a href="http://gandi.net">gandi</a>, and there is some nice <a href="https://www.gandi.net/hosting/iaas">VPS
hosting</a> there. I can have a machine just for Green Ruby there. It can be
neat and open some options. Green Ruby website is still very static. Various
attempts to improve it with a search engine didn&rsquo;t end up to something
concluding yet. Maybe this time it will.</p>

<p>That also may be the occasion to build up a distribution system and move out
of mailchimp. I looked around and all I found was php based. So I will
probably just write my own ruby scripts, the <a href="https://github.com/mikel/mail">mail gem</a> looks great and the
rest is a question of configuring a postfix with correct <a href="http://www.linuxlasse.net/linux/howtos/Postfix_with_DKIM_%28OpenDKIM%29_and_SPF">SPF and DKIM
setup</a>.</p>

<h2 id="je-suis-charlie:dfd863a69df72c13bbe5f0b5d11c54ce">Je suis Charlie</h2>

<p>Well, this tragedy that happened this Thursday in France impacts a lot of
people. Somehow, it perhaps impacts me more than the average. When I was
younger I went to art school to become a cartoonist, and finally I changed my
mind. But I knew the work of the victims of this slaughter. They were icons in
the French cartoon world.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really sad, first because this is murder, second because the irrational
impact it will have on society. This is crazy how a handful of brain-dead
punks can bend history. Now France is going to become even more paranoid. I
already was so uncomfortable when they began to send military with assault
rifles wander in the train stations in Paris. It&rsquo;s not going to get better.</p>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>This week is the 100th edition of Green Ruby, it&rsquo;s also the first one of 2015.
This week the <a href="http://sixgun.org/episodes/lo370">Linux Outlaws</a> broadcasted their last show, and Rebecca
Watson left the <a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/495">Skeptics Guide to the Universe</a>. Those are 2 podcasts that
I never list in the Green Ruby list (they are not really on topic) but I
rarely miss any of them. Too bad they leave. I thought about it too, but no, I
will stay.</p>

<p>So, happy new year or, as we say in french: Bananier!</p>

<p>For 100 weeks already I gathered those links and sent them to whoever wants
them. Every damn single week. Just for the fun of it. This is a kind of
personal kata, it keeps me in the loop. I just make my exercise in a way I can
share it. And my streak of never missing one week is a kind of personal
challenge.</p>

<p>There is now 971 subscribers to the mail newsletter, a whole lot of people
prefer to subscribe using the RSS feed, and the website has 8 or 9k visits per
month. But this is still a side project, with no business behind it. Just one
single guy and a couple of friends sharing the result of their weekly review
of the news of their craft.</p>

<p>So, as you can notice, the edito becomes a rant, and is going to get a bit
longer. For a while I was trying to keep it short just because it sits on the
top of the letter. What matters are the links and not the ranting. By moving
the blah blah at the bottom, I free myself from format constraints and can
unleash my writing desires. muahaha. Not that I have much to say. But you can
consider this new section of Green Ruby as the last screen displayed in <a href="http://www.chucklorre.com/index-bbt.php">The
Big Bang Theory</a>, where producers display some random thoughts, rants or
anecdote. You need to pause the video for being able to read them. Yeah I know
I could just blog like everybody else. But it&rsquo;s just convenient for me to
include this writing in my weekly process.</p>

<p>I also improved formatting for text-only diffusion. There is still something
bugging me about the link tracking, which is mandatory when using the free
tier of Mailchimp service. I guess I will have to find a way around: either I
will get away from mailchimp, either I will find a sponsor to pay for removing
the tracking (sounds funny when I say it that way, no?). Goddamn I hate
tracking-by-default. Maybe I will end up setting up my own postfix with some
mailman. Or use something? If you know a good free software self-hosted
solution for newsletters feel free to drop me a mail.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how many times I saw dev add google analytics on their templates
and at the end nobody was going to check stats except for volume metrics. If
you only need volumetric data, use your web server logs! If you really need
fine metrics, why not consider using self-hosted analytics like <a href="http://piwik.org">Piwik</a>?</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I don&rsquo;t hate analytics. What bothers me is what is made of
those data. Many companies chose as a business model to consider the user as a
merchandise. And most of the time they are not clear about it.</p>

<p>Oh, one last word, next week I will prepare an option so you can chose to
receive only the links and no rant. Or only the rant and no links. Maybe I
will make each section of the letter opt-out too, if you never listen to
podcasts why should you get those, right? I just like choice.</p>

              <p>When you live in your console, it&rsquo;s always good to find ways to stay there. The <code>column</code> command was recently brought to my attention by <a href="https://sysadmincasts.com/episodes/36-cli-monday-column-and-tr">https://sysadmincasts.com/episodes/36-cli-monday-column-and-tr</a> and despite years of console life, godamn I was unaware of this simple tool.</p>

<p>It is very useful for displaying csv files in a readable way, for example:</p>

<pre><code>$ head members_export_0bfc48c38f.csv
LATITUDE,LONGITUDE,CC,REGION
24.7798,120.93,TW,HSZ
52.0927,5.1158,NL,UT
25.0389,121.509,TW,TPE
47.6836,-122.122,US,WA

<p>yuck. Let&rsquo;s prettify it.</p>

              <p>JSON prettifying is a reccurent topic, every coder needs it to keep some sanity. My way to do it has been something like this for a while:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">ruby -rjson -ropen-uri -rawesome_print -e &quot;ap JSON.load(open('http://jsonip.com/'))&quot;
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">{
       &quot;ip&quot; =&gt; &quot;59.115.120.166&quot;,
    &quot;about&quot; =&gt; &quot;/about&quot;,
     &quot;Pro!&quot; =&gt; &quot;http://getjsonip.com&quot;
}
</code></pre>

<p>because when you are rubyist everything can be solve with ruby, obviously.</p>

<p>But well, then one day I did</p>

<pre><code>pip install pjson
</code></pre>

<p>and then</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">curl -s http://jsonip.com | pjson
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;Pro!&quot;: &quot;http://getjsonip.com&quot;,
  &quot;about&quot;: &quot;/about&quot;,
  &quot;ip&quot;: &quot;59.115.120.166&quot;
