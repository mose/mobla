            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>This week I got 2 links that explore both sides of the adwar. The war on
advertisement exists on the web since it became popular enough to attract
advertisers. <a href="https://github.com/fivefilters/block-ads/wiki/There-are-no-acceptable-ads">There are no acceptable ads</a> takes the side of the users,
while <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/03/never-ending-story-ad-blockers">A Never-Ending Story On Ad-Blockers</a> seems to defend and
advise the publishers.</p>

<p>Some media already have blocked the blockers. It&rsquo;s forbidden to escape ads?
This position may appear not to be sustainable. And pushing towards content
sponsoring could have really bad ill effects on the long term. Is there any
escape? Honestly I have to say that I&rsquo;m partial in that debate. I don&rsquo;t like
ads on what I read, and I don&rsquo;t like ads on what I publish. I even go edit my
/etc/hosts with some custom domains to resolve to 127.0.0.1 sometimes.</p>

<p>So it there was to take sides, I would say advertiser, go to hell. But I&rsquo;m a
realist. They won&rsquo;t go away. We live in a society where shit has to be bought.
Yes even if you don&rsquo;t need it. Otherwise the system will collapse. That&rsquo;s how
things are. I get some crazy dreams about some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income">basic income</a>
system, currently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_around_the_world">in experiment</a> in various places over the
globe. Such setup would defeat part of this situation, even if it would have
border effects that are unpredictable. But that would not change much for the
big corpo, it would only save the small people. Hmm. Sounds good enough to me,
I won&rsquo;t lie.</p>

            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>In the long road of my developer life I had the chance to experience a very
wide variety of organizational models. The most pleasant was in the context of
very large open source projects, where actions are not planned but still
organized, and things fall in their place seemingly naturally. Of course there
is nothing natural in that. There is a category of people, that can be called
catalysts, working as gardeners and building the pathways to collaboration.
But because there is no predefined hierarchy, I thought chaos had some
virtues.</p>

<p>In other hierarchical models, there is so much waste following the rule rather
than its essence. It&rsquo;s like there was an abstraction layer for efficiency and
the staff follows the abstraction, paying no respect to the efficiency.
Because after a time the set of rules is not making sense anymore. The
environment moves fast and habits are hard to change. It&rsquo;s taking long time
for an organization to change its own internal rules.</p>

<p>But I also have seen non-hierarchical model totally fail. When you try to
apply an open-source kind of organization inside a company, it cannot be done
half-way, but it cannot be done fully.</p>

<p>For example the volatility of contributors is an essential part of the
open-source organization model. Things are working the way they do because
people are free to leave and join at will, or stop working when they decide.
This is totally different in a company, even if you can get some
approximation, leaving and joining is a more complicated process, and has a
different set of motivations. And let&rsquo;s not talk about the freedom to stop
working at will.</p>

<p>This single factor leads the free-formed communities to get various incentives
for contributors to feel good about their interaction in the community. The
ones that don&rsquo;t play well along other people just end up either in a
leadership position because they are geniuses, or just leave because they
don&rsquo;t fit in. Or they stay and kill the project because everybody else leaves.
But most likely they are the reason why forks exist.</p>

<p>But in a non-hierarchic company, those cowboys may end up hurting the whole
process of collaboration by capturing some processes, getting very good at
them, and give hell to everybody else for a time, under the privilege of the
Power of the Bottleneck. It&rsquo;s very hard to get those people to share knowledge
because their position depends on it. If nothing is done, the situation will
become uneasy and awkward at best.</p>

<p>Certainly in that type of situation, if there is some power in place to
mitigate this danger, all can be good and well. But from my experience such
power is hard to come by. Especially if the non-hierarchic aspect of the
organization depends on him/her/it. Maybe there is some way to have some kind
of catalyst role, but where I have seen such role in a company, it was
informal and not an official position.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s too bad because I would love to experience again some real collective
intelligence in the workplace the same way I have experienced it in some open
source communities. I think maybe there are some companies out there that are
doing that well, but most of the time it&rsquo;s not going to be structural. Most
likely it will come from a specific set of people that do real good in
collaboration. I still wait to see a company that includes in its genetic
code, in its fundamental principle, the seeds that make it possible to be
efficient and still instinctive.</p>

            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              

<p>My attention was brought this week to <a href="http://codeinthedark.com/">Code in the dark events</a>. It seems
pretty cool. A 15 minutes race in html and css with no preview. But the thing
that brought my attention to that format is the special editor used for those
events with a special effect on the cursor. It seems to add a really dramatic
effect on the competition. We need more ideas like that for pure geek fun.</p>

<h2 id="first-look-at-perl-6:f6454540d52b5466477bc9e3371f78a1">First look at perl 6</h2>

<p>For many people, Perl sounds like trauma. Because it didn&rsquo;t move for a while,
when I hear something is perl code, it sounds like it&rsquo;s legacy code, old and
dusty. Well, Perl 6 is going to come out for christmas and the situation may
change. Perl 6 is in the lab for <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?when_will_perl_6_be_released">15 years</a> now, it&rsquo;s more than
time to get it shipped.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://doc.perl6.org/language/5to6-nutshell">first glance</a>, they seem to have tried to &lsquo;modernize&rsquo; the language,
make it more idiomatic. It even seems it looks more like ruby, with the
replacement of arrow by dots, the optional parenthesis, better exception
handling. Well, overall, it feels cleaner. But it also seem to have some
potential to mix functional and object-oriented in an interesting way.</p>

<p>So, maybe there is going to be a second life for the old perl. It&rsquo;s a breaking
version, old perl code will certainly break on the new version. So it&rsquo;s almost
like a new language. For sure I will still keep ruby as my preferred language,
but I like multilingualism, so maybe I will give it a try .. again (last perl
app I wrote was 12 years ago).</p>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>This week I read the <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2015/11/09/software-bullying/">reaction of Avdi</a> to the rant of Linus last
week. He proposes a short but insightful angle by just naming it &lsquo;bullying&rsquo;.
It rejoins the damage that I consider the coder-hero culture brings to our
industry.</p>

<p>Certainly the creative process of writing software attract creative people.
They have strong personalities, some have tendencies to mild autism. They move
mountains and their pride make them work day and night to achieve unbelievable
things.</p>

<p>This is good and well, but on the long run, now that we are passing 2
generations of coders, we know that it&rsquo;s not sustainable on the long run.
Plus, it has a disastrous impact on team building. No pyramid was built by a
single hero.</p>

<p>Incidentally I also read an interesting article about <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-computer-programmers-need-to-stop-calling-themselves-engineers-already-2015-11">Why computer
programmers need to stop calling themselves engineers already</a>.
Even if I can&rsquo;t clearly explain how this is related, I have the feeling it&rsquo;s
talking about something that is in the same area.</p>

              <p>The ruby community is quite blessed in the way that there are very vocal
activist promoting diversity, especially on <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">gender parity</a>. It&rsquo;s
not exclusive to ruby I noticed the same intention in other communities (like
the <a href="http://www.pyladies.com/">pyladies</a> in python).</p>

<p>Anybody that spent some years in IT cannot avoid to notice that there are
mostly guys. The ladies are either frowned upon or very special cases. For
ages I have been wondering why. My sister is a sysadmin at a university, there
is nothing shocking about that and she does a damn good job.</p>

<p>So I paid attention on what are the people responsible for that. I identified
various categories of people that I consider are responsible of our lack of
parity. Well, not them directly but the behaviors they perpetuate are
certainly part of the problem. If we could find a way to correct those
behaviors, it would lead to a natural change in the group.</p>

<p>In all those people I know, and in all their behaviors, I think I detected
something that is related to the Religion Of Competitiveness. Those people are
believers that knowledge is power and they are not gonna share it more than
necessary. They will find anything to avoid more people reach their level of
knowledge. And if they can find some kind of reason to discard other people,
either trivial and socially acceptable in the given group reason to discard
other people, they will do. Gender is the first victim in such a schema. What
is socially acceptable is a self-perpetuated meme.</p>

<p>Talking to those people is pointless, they are in denial. They see nothing
wrong. You can&rsquo;t change them. You have to change their environment, that will
be the only way.</p>

<p>So it means that in a competition context, there are still ways to win, by
playing the competition game and winning it. But to break the competition
paradigm, there is a lot to do. Companies policies are not enough to enforce a
more open mindset. But I believe that there is ways to organize the
information in a way that keeping it for oneself devaluates it. And from the
eradication of the tyranny of knowledge, we shall reach a less
competition-based culture in IT. And all discrimination pretexts may vanish by
themselves.</p>

<p>Rather than fighting for diversity, we should fight against the spirit of
competition. It&rsquo;s kind of not easy, I reckon, because our society tends to
push people to be competitive. That&rsquo;s what capitalism is all about. But IT
population already has proven that the established system don&rsquo;t take hold on
them. Geeks and techies are educated people (often self-educated, but it&rsquo;s the
same) and they can think on their own, chose the path to follow. If you can
find a way, in your context, to change the environment towards less power for
the competitive type of people, that could deserve a try.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s just a rant, a wild thought. Such a topic would deserve more
space for development. But that&rsquo;s what I wanted to share this week. Anyways I
doubt there is that much people reading those line hahaha.</p>

              <p>I enjoyed very much watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TGJJ-F-fE">keynote from Grady Booch at ICSE</a>
last week. He retraces the whole history of computing and software engineering
in a very talented way.</p>

<p>Later on I also watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kEJoWfobpA">keynote of Stephen Bourne at BSDCan</a>,
which also talked about history, but on a specific topic of the creation of
Unix and the shell.</p>

<p>Usually, I have to say, I consider myself as an old geek. But I&rsquo;m a kid
compared to those guys. It made me wonder what are generations based on the
computerized world. In the physical world it&rsquo;s easy, there are births and
generations are around 20-30 years long. But in our accelerated time frame in
the digital age, what is the measure for generations and where are the gaps ?</p>

<p>We could consider that some breakthrough are the base of generational shifts.
On the top of my head I would say:</p>

<ul>
<li>the dinosaurs age, before 70, where computing was just emerging</li>
<li>the university age, appearing with the interconnectivity between universities between 70 and 80</li>
<li>the personal computer age, between 80 and 94, with various evolutions of pc available to larger audience</li>
<li>the hypertext age, between 94 and 2002, start of the public internet, the bubble, the web</li>
<li>the online age, from 2002 to 2012, with consolidation of big companies, web 2.0 and all</li>
<li>the mobile age, from 2012 to now, even if mobile appeared previously, it dominates since recently</li>
</ul>

<p>So I can see an average of 8-15 years in the generations that I feel create
disruptions between each others. People that jump in at one age will suffer a
gap between their age and the next one. Many won&rsquo;t evolve. Few brave ones will
constantly update and jump on the next train.</p>

<p>But the overlap in digital generations is also different than in traditional
generations. We still have a lot of legacy in our current systems inherited
form the university age. And they don&rsquo;t seem to die, like the TCP stack or the
C language.</p>

<p>The next age may be the one of the Internet of things and the massive required
switch to IPv6 as default. Which will include automated and autonomous
systems, because they will be things and not part of a contained system. In
something like 3 to 5 years, if I follow the same rough pattern I drew above.
Unless next gap will come with VR and immersive technologies ?</p>

<p>But I suspect that my simplistic characterization misses all the multi-layered
aspect of the digital age, between the hardware advancements, the software
improvements, the usages evolutions, the protocols modifications, the data
models transformations, etc. I&rsquo;m sure a more complex generational matrix could
be designed if some more thought was given to it. But the gaps are real.</p>

<p>It feels to me that people that predict that machines are going to take over
the world are actually late, it already happened 40 years ago. It was just
having a limited impact on people lives. Each digital generation dragging more
human in its trails.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let yourself enclosed in a generation. Our computer overlords won&rsquo;t make
any effort to include you if you drag your feet.</p>

            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>The topic I talked about last week led me to think about it more widely. And I
ended up with the thinking that many problems in software companies are a
clear problem of balance between their yin and their yang.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang">old chinese principle</a> is documented in a very old-fashioned
way, opposing genders and principles. But actually it sums up in the fact that
many dynamics are to be based in a balance between two opposing principles.
Otherwise they fail.</p>

<p>The way I see it, software developers are a nurturing kind. This profile has
to consider long term. It decides actions for later outcomes. It&rsquo;s about
giving life and growing it. It feels closer to the Yin principle.</p>

<p>On another hand, the business people are bound to a shorter time frame. And I
don&rsquo;t talk about the entrepreneurs and the rare visionary people, but the real
business work force. They are competitive, aggressive, fighters. That really
feels to me like the Yang concept.</p>

<p>And all occurrences where I saw software companies failing, I think it was
because there was a lack of balance between those 2 principles. Either the
management was too soft and not aggressive enough towards its market, either
it was too aggressive and nurturing was not considered enough in their
equation.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that this balance requirement applies to everything, to be
honest. But in a constituted body of a software organization, considering the
current (questionable) market economy, it feels that the Yin and the Yang have
to be in balance to grant a chance of survival to the organization.</p>

<p>One may have the feeling that the dominant Yang (business side) is the more
common case. But they are just more noisy. Many projects stay silently in the
darkness just because there was no real business consideration (or even
refusal of it).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://modeling-languages.com/grady-booch-on-the-future-of-software-engineering-video-and-highlights/">keynote of Grady Booch</a> (linked in the video section) confirmed
me in various ways in this opinion. Engineers have the duty to fight for the
balance when they can. They have to understand that it&rsquo;s not a one-way deal,
as well. If you want to exercise programming in a nurturing-only context, win
a lottery and dedicate your time writing free software (where market
requirements don&rsquo;t apply). But in the usual case, you may have to consider if
you are in a balanced context, and if not, try to work on balancing it.</p>

              <a href="http://blog.mose.com/2015/06/14/a-word-about-project-gardening" class="post-title">A word about project gardening</a>
            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>In the last 2 companies where I worked, there was this recurring issue.
Actually I noticed it for a while but for some reasons it became more obvious
to me with time passing. The project management role is usually badly
fulfilled.</p>

<p>But at some point, and even from the point of view of a developer, there is in
projects the need for a dedicated person for doing some gardening. Yeah it&rsquo;s
all about daily ungrateful clearing the bad weeds, making sure the soil is
rich enough, and that the seeds are all planted where they should be planted,
that soil pH is adequate for this or that variety. Having someone that is just
doing moderation on projects also frees the productive people from lengthly
and sometimes non technical meetings. It is the occasion to have someone that
keeps track of specs, sometimes gather them or (re)write them down in a
central place.</p>

<p>The problem in the transition from waterfall to agile, is that in the
waterfall model there is a hierarchic feeling in the role of the project
manager. The Management word into it is misleading. It leads the developers to
frown upon it. I have the impression that in agile teams, project management
is supposed to be taken care of organically by the dev teams, sometimes by the
scrum master or whatever facilitator is there for enforcing the agile process.
Or the product owner will be technical enough to fill up that role. More or
less.</p>

<p>But the reality is that project grooming is a full time job that may have to
be re-invented. It certainly should take in account developers creativity and
pertinence in the match of the objectives with the technical realities. But
it&rsquo;s necessary to have a person that is the reference on keeping track of the
need and follow the quality process at all the stages. Well, at least when you
begin to get many developers and many projects, and developers that work on
many projects.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s a question of scale. Companies with less than 30 people may never
face that need because there is a natural fluidity internally and not that
many projects. But when you get to 100 and you still don&rsquo;t have people
dedicated to projects, then you can see developers burning out. Projects
become lousy because nobody has time to write specs. You also can see
emergence of hero coders that can by miracle make it all happen. But you will
postpone the problem because heroes are not scalable and can even be toxic on
the long run (as any experienced practitioner already knows).</p>

<p>Personally in my technical career I never liked the project managers that I
met. But that is a long time I didn&rsquo;t meet any. It dates from an age where
agile was not there yet. But now that I don&rsquo;t see them anymore, I feel that
something is missing. It certainly exists in various places. And I can bet
that many of them are as bad as they were in the last century. But maybe there
is a new species of project curators out there that I didn&rsquo;t meet yet. I read
about those in various places, but in my (small) world, this is still a
mythical beast.</p>

            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>This weekend there was a python conference here in Taipei (<a href="https://tw.pycon.org/2015apac/en/">pycon apac</a>).
As Gandi was sponsoring it, I <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/43946968@N07/sets/72157653640049980">went there</a> and tried to
figure out how python and ruby communities differ in my local area. As a
matter of fact, I also push my python coding skills a bit. I kind of like to
nurture a general polyglot approach.</p>

<p>It first seems that the python community is more largely supported by sponsors
than ruby one. It&rsquo;s more mainstream in the general engineering world, I guess.
There was google, facebook, microsoft, having a table and talking about their
cloud things. But the general setup was pretty similar to the ruby or rails
conf I&rsquo;ve been in.</p>

<p>The topics in this conference were maybe a little more scientific and less
web-oriented than we can find in ruby world. Python has tighter bindings with
lower level languages. I think it&rsquo;s not a specificity of the language because
you also can build C extensions for ruby. But it&rsquo;s more a result of the
community interests.</p>

<p>I have the feeling that the ruby community dedicated more efforts towards the
web front and other rails related principle like testing suites, DSL and
meta-programming. But my general feeling is that there is no technical reason
for that. It&rsquo;s just how things happened over time, mostly given the weight of
rails in the ruby communities.</p>

<p>Actually, I also had the feeling that pythonists don&rsquo;t consider ruby as a
&lsquo;competitor&rsquo;. They feel closer to java, node or golang, and at various
occasion I had the impression that they consider ruby to be only the language
behind rails.</p>

<p>I also thought that the ruby community was special about its adoption of
macbook laptops. Even if actually the python coder has more diversity, I
evaluate around half macbooks, the rest split between ubuntu and windows. It&rsquo;s
less that in ruby confs where macbooks are kinda 90% and windows users are
very few.</p>

<p>Also, I noticed a similar movement about diversity with <a href="http://djangogirls.org/taipei/">django girls</a>
and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesTW/">pyladies</a>, comparable to the rails girls,
which tries to close the gender gap in the engineering world.</p>

<p>Anyways that was good and interesting. Geeks are the same kind, whatever
language they use (by trade or by taste). I strongly advise, if you have the
occasion, to wander out of your usual communities and join other circles. It
gives a good perspective on you usual world.</p>

              <a href="http://blog.mose.com/2015/05/24/the-side-effects-of-recruitment" class="post-title">The side effects of recruitment</a>
            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>Recently I had to look for a new devops for our team. I have been handling
technical recruitment at many occasions, and each time I have to explain my
colleagues that I have a special process. The fact is, the technical sphere is
a small one, we are all linked, more or less, to a community. Well, in my
case, I always have had to recruit people in companies that were hiring the
kind of people that commit on github, have some kind of community activity, at
least. I guess that in huge companies where people are just a set of
checkboxes, things go a bit differently.</p>

<p>But anyways, in my case, and probably in the case of all recruiters in modern
and small businesses, it&rsquo;s not all about checkboxes and profiles. It&rsquo;s about
personality, compatibility, and mindset. So when I first get a contact with a
candidate, I invite him (or much more rarely, her), to a chat online,
preferably on irc or whatever real-time discussion media is more fit (for a
linux geek, if you can&rsquo;t go on irc, then there is a problem).</p>

<p>I noticed that during my past sessions of recruitment, I established contacts
with very interesting people. By having an unformal discussion online, just
chit-chating of what work we do and what we did before, it&rsquo;s kind of easy to
get an idea of what is the kind of relationship you will have with your
potential future colleague. But beyond that, it&rsquo;s all about making things
personal. We are all unique. It cannot be computed, scripted, engineered in a
way that non-technical people would be successful conducting that process. It
takes a geek to recognize another geek.</p>

<p>At Gandi of course we have a HR person. But she usually appears at the very
end of the process and not at the beginning. The peers are going to evaluate
candidates, make their mind to see if they want to spend days and days
collaborating with them. It matches with my way to do things, fortunately. If
I have any doubt of the technical abilities on someone, I don&rsquo;t do stupid
technical tests, I try to find other people that know the candidate and get
third party feedback. If not, then I try to use a meetup in a community
related to the speciality in question, so we can discuss and be around other
people where some tangent discussion can happen.</p>

<p>At the end, if all goes well, then the candidate is going to enter the more
formal whatever the company uses as a recruitment flow. But that&rsquo;s merely a
formality. And after 20 years building up teams and recruiting people, I can
affirm that instinct always wins, in my case. If I smell anything fishy in an
unformal context, there is going to be problems. Well, the process is never
perfect, it also can smell ok but stink after 3 months, too.</p>

<p>But the thing is that having those chats online with peers is pretty
interesting. I learn a lot about how other companies work, how they handle
their management, what kind of work conditions they have. Just because it&rsquo;s
part of the contact process. So I&rsquo;m not really in hurry to make a final
decision because, to be honest, I just enjoy those contacts.</p>

<p>It certainly takes some time, I can&rsquo;t be in constant recruitment, but from
time to time, it&rsquo;s very valuable. And not only for the effect of recruiting
someone. It creates bonds with the industry, with people, with communities.</p>
