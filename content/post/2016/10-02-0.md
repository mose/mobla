Great occasion to kick thunderbird byebye and spend some time on configuring
my mutt to make it real again, after 6 years of click-click for mail. I was a
mutt user for a very long time, and my pause for trying a GUI mail client just
had to have an end. But the mail has clearly become something else now.
Actually much more volume, but much more automated things, and news feeds. Or
it's just me?
