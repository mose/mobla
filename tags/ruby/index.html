<h2 id="multiple-inheritance-simulation:a9a546e37849f6a570839940ccf98c98">Multiple inheritance simulation</h2>

<p>This is a bit twisted. In ruby, as you know, you cannot use multiple
inheritance. But the flexibility of the language, especially the
metaprogramming aspect, opens the door for some cheating. Check out
<a href="https://gist.github.com/capitalist/473543b7ea24d461d030">this code</a>, it tricks it by declaring the first class as the super
class and the remaining classes as modules included in that super class.
Pretty acrobatic and elegant, imho.</p>

<h2 id="about-vaping:a9a546e37849f6a570839940ccf98c98">About vaping</h2>

<p>Well this has been my burden for 30 years, and I&rsquo;m not proud of it. But last
week it finally ended. I quit smoking. But this was kindof a trick, as it was
made possible by switching to <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5-facts-that-everyone-gets-wrong-about-vaping-1659938937">vaping</a>. It certainly doesn&rsquo;t solve the
nicotine addiction issue, but I&rsquo;m very happy with this move and hopeful for a
gradual freedom.</p>

<p>I also found out that this vaping practice is very geeky. The hardware part is
quite elaborate, vaping devices are really neat piece of work, there are a
bunch of vendors. The liquidware is also quite a subject of hacking.
Technically it&rsquo;s not that hard to do it yourself. Not surprising that I
discovered this vaping practice in geeks circles.</p>

<h2 id="about-blogging:111d43eaf8a2a6adad496f0417e7f52c">About blogging</h2>

<p>Well, since that whole blogging thing began, I never have been very active on
it. Well, I have a <a href="http://blog.mose.com">blog</a> on Tumblr because I wanted to know how they
are doing it, I published various posts in the <a href="http://devtips.faria.co/authors.html#mose-ref">faria devtips</a>, and
after all, this rant could also count as a publication. So I think I will
gather them all under one unique site. A Jekyll github-pages kind, easy and
cheap.</p>

<p>After all, I&rsquo;m not sure the devtips website will stay up any longer. There
have been no post since the day I left. Too bad. It&rsquo;s a demonstration that
some collective actions can sometimes rely only on the energy of one person.</p>

<p>So, I made a <a href="http://mose.github.io/blog">new repo</a> on github for it, and I will gather whatever
stuff I can find that I wrote in there.</p>

<h2 id="lovely-freebsd:111d43eaf8a2a6adad496f0417e7f52c">Lovely FreeBSD</h2>

<p>At our Gandi office in Taipei I had to install a <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/">pfsense</a> server,
which is based on <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>. It was quite a pleasant experience,
actually. Last time I played a bit with BSD that was 12 years ago, and that
was not very smooth. I&rsquo;m happy to be given that occasion to see how it goes
now.</p>

<p>For now I&rsquo;m going to use it like if it was an <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a> with some
extra <a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source.html">OpenVPN</a> abilities. And it will also be a file server for the
LAN. Not sure yet how I will handle that.</p>

<h2 id="ruby-package-management:111d43eaf8a2a6adad496f0417e7f52c">Ruby package management</h2>

<p>When I got in my new job, I discovered a new way to manage server management.
They didn&rsquo;t want to use <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a>, or even <a href="https://rubygems.org/">ruby gems</a>, or
<a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/">pip</a> or anything that is not debian packages. It may sound quite harsh.
Since I came in ruby in 2010, rvm has been my best friend, bundle the second
one. But this approach is very developer-based. When you maintain large and
stable systems, it&rsquo;s more likely that you will not trust the bleeding edge
stuff and prefer confirmed publication of packages before using them. This is
an interesting slap on my face.</p>

<p>Of course there are the <a href="https://www.brightbox.com/docs/ruby/ubuntu/">brightbox</a> packages for Ubuntu, but that&rsquo;s
missing the point. A release has to be out for a certain time so it can be
strengthened by security reviews and proper production usage. There is a part
of the population for each language that is considering the instability of
current releases a normal trade-off. but there is a huge lot of other
companies that will wait patiently that things get stable enough for their
taste.</p>

<h2 id="working-abroad:a0091e7eb1dfeca477447c7e0b2e6425">Working abroad</h2>

<p>Our craft as webdev is clearly in huge demand. This provides an opportunity
for us to travel abroad, discover new cultures, widen our horizon. When I went
to live in Taiwan, I was not worried about finding a job. But when hunting for
a job abroad it can be tricky to find companies that will sponsor a visa, a
work permit, or whatever legal requirement is involved in each countries.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what the new initiative called <a href="http://techmeabroad.com">TechMeAbroad</a> aims to fix, by
listing only job opportunities for which a work permit is sponsored. As
<a href="http://jbarbier42.tumblr.com/post/112155851079/introducing-techmeabroad">Julien Barbier explains</a>, it will launch in march, and if you know of any
job offers that includes a visa or such thing, please let him know (or send it
to me I will pass it along), so we can feed that platform with some real data
quickly.</p>

<h2 id="so-long-ruby-1-9:a0091e7eb1dfeca477447c7e0b2e6425">So long ruby 1.9</h2>

<p>As planned, it&rsquo;s now time to say <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2015/02/23/support-for-ruby-1-9-3-has-ended/">byebye to ruby 1.9.3</a>. But there is still
so many old version of ruby in the wild. In debian squeeze, you gotta use 1.8.
In wheezy, you have 1.9. And there are still many servers that will refuse to
upgrade.</p>

<p>The registration for <a href="http://rubyheroes.com/">Ruby Heroes 2015</a> is now open. Go vote for your
favorite ruby influential dev. You have until <a href="http://railsconf.com/">railsconf</a> that will happen

<h2 id="while42:7b1eab39a4e6e397eafd98271e67cb67">While42</h2>

<p>This week I got in contact with Sylvain from <a href="http://while42.org">while42</a>. It&rsquo;s a social
network for french tech engineers, but with a special touch on it. There is no
facebook page or google group. They intentionally decided to be irl-first. For
people that are most likely to be online all the time, this sounds so
therapeutic! So, I decided, with Thomas from Gandi, to setup a Taiwan chapter.
If you want to know more (and are french, engineer, and living in Taipei) just
drop me a mail.</p>

<h2 id="traveling-ruby:7b1eab39a4e6e397eafd98271e67cb67">Traveling ruby</h2>

<p>This is a project from the <a href="http://www.phusion.nl/">Phusion</a> people, called <a href="https://github.com/phusion/traveling-ruby">Traveling ruby</a>.
Its purpose is to make it easy to build auto-sustaining tarballs for ruby
programms, including ruby binary and all gems in it. That way you can publish
a tarball and your customer/user will just launch whatever you put in it. No
need to install ruby or any gems.</p>

<p>I gave it a try yesterday on my <a href="https://github.com/eduvo/zabbix-ruby-client">zabbix-ruby-client</a> gem, and after a few
tweaks (mostly because I wanted to use an unpublished version of my gem), it
all worked pretty fine. Result is a tarball of 8M. Uploaded to the server (an
old squeeze), it just ran the self-contained ruby 2.1.5 with no hassle. It
reminded me a bit of the feeling when you upload a go executable on the
server. Really neat.</p>

<h2 id="palm-control:7b1eab39a4e6e397eafd98271e67cb67">Palm control</h2>

<p>There are tiny things that can change a lot. My recent tiny thing is the palm
control technique. Every sunday when I prepare Green Ruby I do a huge amount
of copy pasting all over the place. Recently I found on a post about keyboard
someone talking about the palm control technique for avoiding the copypaste
fatigue.</p>

<p>Well, you need to have a keyboard that makes it possible. Mine is a <a href="http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/10104">Logitech washable k310</a>.
I already liked its look, and even better, it&rsquo;s perfect for
this palm thing because keys are prominent. Use the palm to push control and
then it&rsquo;s only a matter of hitting c or v with the index. Honestly, it changed
my life!</p>

              <a href="http://blog.mose.com/2014/06/12/s3-backups" class="post-title">S3 backups</a>
            </header>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>We use S3 to backup various kind of files on MB. We use the very convenient backup gem for that (we still use 3.9.0).</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://meskyanichi.github.io/backup/v4/">http://meskyanichi.github.io/backup/v4/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But at some point it appeared that backing up our audio recording was hammering disk IO on our server, because the syncer is calculating md5 footprint for each file each time a backup happens. When you get thousands of big files that is pretty expensive process (in our case 20k files and 50G total).</p>

<p>So I added a small trick there:</p>

<p>in <code>Backup/models/backup_audio.rb</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">module Backup::Syncer::Cloud
  class Base &lt; Syncer::Base
    def process_orphans
      if @orphans.is_a?(Queue)
        @orphans = @orphans.size.times.map { @orphans.shift }
      end
      &quot;Older Files: #{ @orphans.count }&quot;
    end
  end
end

Backup::Model.new(:backup_audio, 'Audio files Backup to S3') do

  before do
    system(&quot;/Backup/latest_audio.sh&quot;)
  end

  after do
    FileUtils.rm_rf(&quot;/tmp/streams&quot;)
  end

  ##
  # Amazon Simple Storage Service [Syncer]
  #
  sync_with Cloud::S3 do |s3|
    s3.access_key_id     = &quot;xxx&quot;
    s3.secret_access_key = &quot;xxx&quot;
    s3.bucket            = &quot;bucket_backup&quot;
    s3.region            = &quot;us-east-1&quot;
    s3.path              = &quot;/mb_audio_backup&quot;
    s3.mirror            = false
    s3.thread_count      = 50

    s3.directories do |directory|
      directory.add &quot;/tmp/streams&quot;
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>and in <code>Backup/latest_audio.sh</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/sh
# isolate files changed in the last 3 days

TMPDIR=/tmp/streams

mkdir $TMPDIR
for i in `find /storage/audio/ -type f -cmin -4320`; do
  ln -s $i $TMPDIR
done
</code></pre>

<p>It creates a fake backup dir with links to the files that actually changed in the last 3 days and patches the syncer to avoid flooding the logs with orphan files. When sometimes S3 upload fails on one file (and it happens from time to time for &lsquo;amazonian&rsquo; reason) it will be caught on the next daily backup.</p>

<p>The result was pretty obvious on our disk usage with our daily backups:</p>

<p>These steps are my typical path, nothing is really mandatory there.</p>

<ul>
<li>create a repo at github (or wherever you want)</li>
<li>create a base gem skeleton <code>bundle gem mycoolgem</code></li>
<li>update the README.md, add some minimal information. The clearest you explain what it does the best chances people will adopt it. Add cypirght information</li>
<li>create a CHANGELOG.md because when you publish something you need a clear log of your version changes</li>
<li>enable the tracking on <a href="https://codeclimate.com/">codeclimate</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">travis</a>, <a href="https://coveralls.io/">coveralls</a>, <a href="https://gemnasium.com">gemnasium</a></li>
<li>add badges from <a href="http://shields.io">http://shields.io</a> in the README.md because it helps to qualify the state of the code quickly</li>
<li>when the gem code don&rsquo;t need to have access to the version number, I found convenient to just remove the version file and add version in the .gemspec from the changelog file with <code>spec.version  = File.read(File.expand_path('../CHANGELOG.md', __FILE__))[/([0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)/]</code>
(so then when I version bump there is only one file to edit)</li>
<li>write the code (or copy it from the private app you extract it from)</li>
<li>add a spec/ or test/ dir and write some tests and try to reach a decent coverage</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="release-it:a6c8c79e924ce88903bef7ff7392e41e">Release it</h2>

<ul>
<li>add the date in the changelog for the current version</li>
<li><code>rake release</code></li>
<li>bump the version to the next increment in the changelog (and version file if any)</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall with the initial bundle command and the final rake task for release, it&rsquo;s pretty straightforward.</p>

              <p>I have been looking for a way to see what gem uses a gem, so I can see examples of integration in other projects. The rubygems API guide don&rsquo;t tell anything about such reverse dependency query. But it is actually there, it got merged some time ago, and optimized, but it is not documented yet (it runs really fast, kudos Rubygems guys).</p>

              <p>In Faria we use hackpad a lot, it&rsquo;s pretty useful. Mose made a command line interface so he can download all the pads locally and grep them all in one go. It also transforms the markdown much better than the original hackpad markdown export, which totally sucks (as for now). So pads can be recycled easily in github wiki pages.</p>

            <div class="post-description">
              <p>Sometimes when doing some mechanical operation on my home workstation, involving repetitive action or something requiring low level of attention (like sorting mails, lurking on irc, updating a distro, …), I like to put the headset and listen to stuff. But I never had any taste for music, I prefer listening to people that talk about some interesting topic.</p>

<p>I began this when starting working with rails, because that was a great flow of information, that had various sources:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://rubyrogues.com">http://rubyrogues.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rubyshow.com">http://rubyshow.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://learn.thoughtbot.com/podcast">http://learn.thoughtbot.com/podcast</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ruby5.envylabs.com">http://ruby5.envylabs.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All was good and then I checked out podcast clients for my environment (linux with ubuntu) and I found out <a href="http://gpodder.net">http://gpodder.net</a> which is exactly the kind of software I like. I does not much but what it does is well done. The website is a nice optional addition, only focused on podcasts and has a nice simple design and is free.</p>

<pre><code>apt-get install gpodder
</code></pre>

<p>Then I discovered a few other podcasts for hackers, or oriented towards science and knowledge. And I removed the rss feed I had in my thunderbird for listening to some French-speaking radio shows (like la-bas si j&rsquo;y suis).</p>

<p>The website makes possible to publish your subscription list, here is my list of very geeky selection:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gpodder.net/user/mose/subscriptions">https://gpodder.net/user/mose/subscriptions</a></li>
