&lt;h2 id=&#34;sexism-and-competition:db2c111cf24dad5b31c1182c9980822d&#34;&gt;Sexism and competition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ruby community is quite blessed in the way that there are very vocal
activist promoting diversity, especially on &lt;a href=&#34;http://railsgirls.com/&#34;&gt;gender parity&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s
not exclusive to ruby I noticed the same intention in other communities (like
the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pyladies.com/&#34;&gt;pyladies&lt;/a&gt; in python).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anybody that spent some years in IT cannot avoid to notice that there are
mostly guys. The ladies are either frowned upon or very special cases. For
ages I have been wondering why. My sister is a sysadmin at a university, there
is nothing shocking about that and she does a damn good job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I paid attention on what are the people responsible for that. I identified
various categories of people that I consider are responsible of our lack of
parity. Well, not them directly but the behaviors they perpetuate are
certainly part of the problem. If we could find a way to correct those
behaviors, it would lead to a natural change in the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all those people I know, and in all their behaviors, I think I detected
something that is related to the Religion Of Competitiveness. Those people are
believers that knowledge is power and they are not gonna share it more than
necessary. They will find anything to avoid more people reach their level of
knowledge. And if they can find some kind of reason to discard other people,
either trivial and socially acceptable in the given group reason to discard
other people, they will do. Gender is the first victim in such a schema. What
is socially acceptable is a self-perpetuated meme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking to those people is pointless, they are in denial. They see nothing
wrong. You can&amp;rsquo;t change them. You have to change their environment, that will
be the only way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it means that in a competition context, there are still ways to win, by
playing the competition game and winning it. But to break the competition
paradigm, there is a lot to do. Companies policies are not enough to enforce a
more open mindset. But I believe that there is ways to organize the
information in a way that keeping it for oneself devaluates it. And from the
eradication of the tyranny of knowledge, we shall reach a less
competition-based culture in IT. And all discrimination pretexts may vanish by
themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than fighting for diversity, we should fight against the spirit of
competition. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of not easy, I reckon, because our society tends to
push people to be competitive. That&amp;rsquo;s what capitalism is all about. But IT
population already has proven that the established system don&amp;rsquo;t take hold on
them. Geeks and techies are educated people (often self-educated, but it&amp;rsquo;s the
same) and they can think on their own, chose the path to follow. If you can
find a way, in your context, to change the environment towards less power for
the competitive type of people, that could deserve a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s just a rant, a wild thought. Such a topic would deserve more
space for development. But that&amp;rsquo;s what I wanted to share this week. Anyways I
doubt there is that much people reading those line hahaha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;digital-generations:2aa08ef814c13d38c5b673b5d5882db4&#34;&gt;Digital Generations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed very much watching the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TGJJ-F-fE&#34;&gt;keynote from Grady Booch at ICSE&lt;/a&gt;
last week. He retraces the whole history of computing and software engineering
in a very talented way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on I also watched the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kEJoWfobpA&#34;&gt;keynote of Stephen Bourne at BSDCan&lt;/a&gt;,
which also talked about history, but on a specific topic of the creation of
Unix and the shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, I have to say, I consider myself as an old geek. But I&amp;rsquo;m a kid
compared to those guys. It made me wonder what are generations based on the
computerized world. In the physical world it&amp;rsquo;s easy, there are births and
generations are around 20-30 years long. But in our accelerated time frame in
the digital age, what is the measure for generations and where are the gaps ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could consider that some breakthrough are the base of generational shifts.
On the top of my head I would say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dinosaurs age, before 70, where computing was just emerging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the university age, appearing with the interconnectivity between universities between 70 and 80&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the personal computer age, between 80 and 94, with various evolutions of pc available to larger audience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the hypertext age, between 94 and 2002, start of the public internet, the bubble, the web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the online age, from 2002 to 2012, with consolidation of big companies, web 2.0 and all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the mobile age, from 2012 to now, even if mobile appeared previously, it dominates since recently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I can see an average of 8-15 years in the generations that I feel create
disruptions between each others. People that jump in at one age will suffer a
gap between their age and the next one. Many won&amp;rsquo;t evolve. Few brave ones will
constantly update and jump on the next train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the overlap in digital generations is also different than in traditional
generations. We still have a lot of legacy in our current systems inherited
form the university age. And they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to die, like the TCP stack or the
C language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next age may be the one of the Internet of things and the massive required
switch to IPv6 as default. Which will include automated and autonomous
systems, because they will be things and not part of a contained system. In
something like 3 to 5 years, if I follow the same rough pattern I drew above.
Unless next gap will come with VR and immersive technologies ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I suspect that my simplistic characterization misses all the multi-layered
aspect of the digital age, between the hardware advancements, the software
improvements, the usages evolutions, the protocols modifications, the data
models transformations, etc. I&amp;rsquo;m sure a more complex generational matrix could
be designed if some more thought was given to it. But the gaps are real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels to me that people that predict that machines are going to take over
the world are actually late, it already happened 40 years ago. It was just
having a limited impact on people lives. Each digital generation dragging more
human in its trails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t let yourself enclosed in a generation. Our computer overlords won&amp;rsquo;t make
any effort to include you if you drag your feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-yin-and-yang-of-software-development:aff213456bcfa77c48418a9edd40a18a&#34;&gt;The yin and yang of software development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic I talked about last week led me to think about it more widely. And I
ended up with the thinking that many problems in software companies are a
clear problem of balance between their yin and their yang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang&#34;&gt;old chinese principle&lt;/a&gt; is documented in a very old-fashioned
way, opposing genders and principles. But actually it sums up in the fact that
many dynamics are to be based in a balance between two opposing principles.
Otherwise they fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, software developers are a nurturing kind. This profile has
to consider long term. It decides actions for later outcomes. It&amp;rsquo;s about
giving life and growing it. It feels closer to the Yin principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another hand, the business people are bound to a shorter time frame. And I
don&amp;rsquo;t talk about the entrepreneurs and the rare visionary people, but the real
business work force. They are competitive, aggressive, fighters. That really
feels to me like the Yang concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all occurrences where I saw software companies failing, I think it was
because there was a lack of balance between those 2 principles. Either the
management was too soft and not aggressive enough towards its market, either
it was too aggressive and nurturing was not considered enough in their
equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think that this balance requirement applies to everything, to be
honest. But in a constituted body of a software organization, considering the
current (questionable) market economy, it feels that the Yin and the Yang have
to be in balance to grant a chance of survival to the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One may have the feeling that the dominant Yang (business side) is the more
common case. But they are just more noisy. Many projects stay silently in the
darkness just because there was no real business consideration (or even
refusal of it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://modeling-languages.com/grady-booch-on-the-future-of-software-engineering-video-and-highlights/&#34;&gt;keynote of Grady Booch&lt;/a&gt; (linked in the video section) confirmed
me in various ways in this opinion. Engineers have the duty to fight for the
balance when they can. They have to understand that it&amp;rsquo;s not a one-way deal,
as well. If you want to exercise programming in a nurturing-only context, win
a lottery and dedicate your time writing free software (where market
requirements don&amp;rsquo;t apply). But in the usual case, you may have to consider if
you are in a balanced context, and if not, try to work on balancing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-word-about-project-gardening:3f19ca908c642cafd8c3253d0dfb2a28&#34;&gt;A word about project gardening&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last 2 companies where I worked, there was this recurring issue.
Actually I noticed it for a while but for some reasons it became more obvious
to me with time passing. The project management role is usually badly
fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at some point, and even from the point of view of a developer, there is in
projects the need for a dedicated person for doing some gardening. Yeah it&amp;rsquo;s
all about daily ungrateful clearing the bad weeds, making sure the soil is
rich enough, and that the seeds are all planted where they should be planted,
that soil pH is adequate for this or that variety. Having someone that is just
doing moderation on projects also frees the productive people from lengthly
and sometimes non technical meetings. It is the occasion to have someone that
keeps track of specs, sometimes gather them or (re)write them down in a
central place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem in the transition from waterfall to agile, is that in the
waterfall model there is a hierarchic feeling in the role of the project
manager. The Management word into it is misleading. It leads the developers to
frown upon it. I have the impression that in agile teams, project management
is supposed to be taken care of organically by the dev teams, sometimes by the
scrum master or whatever facilitator is there for enforcing the agile process.
Or the product owner will be technical enough to fill up that role. More or
less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the reality is that project grooming is a full time job that may have to
be re-invented. It certainly should take in account developers creativity and
pertinence in the match of the objectives with the technical realities. But
it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to have a person that is the reference on keeping track of the
need and follow the quality process at all the stages. Well, at least when you
begin to get many developers and many projects, and developers that work on
many projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s a question of scale. Companies with less than 30 people may never
face that need because there is a natural fluidity internally and not that
many projects. But when you get to 100 and you still don&amp;rsquo;t have people
dedicated to projects, then you can see developers burning out. Projects
become lousy because nobody has time to write specs. You also can see
emergence of hero coders that can by miracle make it all happen. But you will
postpone the problem because heroes are not scalable and can even be toxic on
the long run (as any experienced practitioner already knows).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally in my technical career I never liked the project managers that I
met. But that is a long time I didn&amp;rsquo;t meet any. It dates from an age where
agile was not there yet. But now that I don&amp;rsquo;t see them anymore, I feel that
something is missing. It certainly exists in various places. And I can bet
that many of them are as bad as they were in the last century. But maybe there
is a new species of project curators out there that I didn&amp;rsquo;t meet yet. I read
about those in various places, but in my (small) world, this is still a
mythical beast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thought-about-python-fron-a-rubyist:cdf97fab83b684f4dce127ec09f067df&#34;&gt;Thought about python fron a rubyist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend there was a python conference here in Taipei (&lt;a href=&#34;https://tw.pycon.org/2015apac/en/&#34;&gt;pycon apac&lt;/a&gt;).
As Gandi was sponsoring it, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/43946968@N07/sets/72157653640049980&#34;&gt;went there&lt;/a&gt; and tried to
figure out how python and ruby communities differ in my local area. As a
matter of fact, I also push my python coding skills a bit. I kind of like to
nurture a general polyglot approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It first seems that the python community is more largely supported by sponsors
than ruby one. It&amp;rsquo;s more mainstream in the general engineering world, I guess.
There was google, facebook, microsoft, having a table and talking about their
cloud things. But the general setup was pretty similar to the ruby or rails
conf I&amp;rsquo;ve been in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topics in this conference were maybe a little more scientific and less
web-oriented than we can find in ruby world. Python has tighter bindings with
lower level languages. I think it&amp;rsquo;s not a specificity of the language because
you also can build C extensions for ruby. But it&amp;rsquo;s more a result of the
community interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the feeling that the ruby community dedicated more efforts towards the
web front and other rails related principle like testing suites, DSL and
meta-programming. But my general feeling is that there is no technical reason
for that. It&amp;rsquo;s just how things happened over time, mostly given the weight of
rails in the ruby communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I also had the feeling that pythonists don&amp;rsquo;t consider ruby as a
&amp;lsquo;competitor&amp;rsquo;. They feel closer to java, node or golang, and at various
occasion I had the impression that they consider ruby to be only the language
behind rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also thought that the ruby community was special about its adoption of
macbook laptops. Even if actually the python coder has more diversity, I
evaluate around half macbooks, the rest split between ubuntu and windows. It&amp;rsquo;s
less that in ruby confs where macbooks are kinda 90% and windows users are
very few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I noticed a similar movement about diversity with &lt;a href=&#34;http://djangogirls.org/taipei/&#34;&gt;django girls&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesTW/&#34;&gt;pyladies&lt;/a&gt;, comparable to the rails girls,
which tries to close the gender gap in the engineering world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways that was good and interesting. Geeks are the same kind, whatever
language they use (by trade or by taste). I strongly advise, if you have the
occasion, to wander out of your usual communities and join other circles. It
gives a good perspective on you usual world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-side-effects-of-recruitment:849328e7dfc904a2b6d861e0036f0df4&#34;&gt;The side effects of recruitment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I had to look for a new devops for our team. I have been handling
technical recruitment at many occasions, and each time I have to explain my
colleagues that I have a special process. The fact is, the technical sphere is
a small one, we are all linked, more or less, to a community. Well, in my
case, I always have had to recruit people in companies that were hiring the
kind of people that commit on github, have some kind of community activity, at
least. I guess that in huge companies where people are just a set of
checkboxes, things go a bit differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But anyways, in my case, and probably in the case of all recruiters in modern
and small businesses, it&amp;rsquo;s not all about checkboxes and profiles. It&amp;rsquo;s about
personality, compatibility, and mindset. So when I first get a contact with a
candidate, I invite him (or much more rarely, her), to a chat online,
preferably on irc or whatever real-time discussion media is more fit (for a
linux geek, if you can&amp;rsquo;t go on irc, then there is a problem).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed that during my past sessions of recruitment, I established contacts
with very interesting people. By having an unformal discussion online, just
chit-chating of what work we do and what we did before, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of easy to
get an idea of what is the kind of relationship you will have with your
potential future colleague. But beyond that, it&amp;rsquo;s all about making things
personal. We are all unique. It cannot be computed, scripted, engineered in a
way that non-technical people would be successful conducting that process. It
takes a geek to recognize another geek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Gandi of course we have a HR person. But she usually appears at the very
end of the process and not at the beginning. The peers are going to evaluate
candidates, make their mind to see if they want to spend days and days
collaborating with them. It matches with my way to do things, fortunately. If
I have any doubt of the technical abilities on someone, I don&amp;rsquo;t do stupid
technical tests, I try to find other people that know the candidate and get
third party feedback. If not, then I try to use a meetup in a community
related to the speciality in question, so we can discuss and be around other
people where some tangent discussion can happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end, if all goes well, then the candidate is going to enter the more
formal whatever the company uses as a recruitment flow. But that&amp;rsquo;s merely a
formality. And after 20 years building up teams and recruiting people, I can
affirm that instinct always wins, in my case. If I smell anything fishy in an
unformal context, there is going to be problems. Well, the process is never
perfect, it also can smell ok but stink after 3 months, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the thing is that having those chats online with peers is pretty
interesting. I learn a lot about how other companies work, how they handle
their management, what kind of work conditions they have. Just because it&amp;rsquo;s
part of the contact process. So I&amp;rsquo;m not really in hurry to make a final
decision because, to be honest, I just enjoy those contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It certainly takes some time, I can&amp;rsquo;t be in constant recruitment, but from
time to time, it&amp;rsquo;s very valuable. And not only for the effect of recruiting
someone. It creates bonds with the industry, with people, with communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;noobs-rule-the-planet:fb906e6159a53dc43f4de9d255805b75&#34;&gt;Noobs rule the planet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something that I always did in my career managing internet tools. I
volunteer helping non-technical people to get a presence online, build up
communities and such things. But I have to confess, this comes with a price. A
price on your nerves when you realize that easy obvious things that you take
for granted are actually not clear at all by the average Joe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah sure they can post of facebook. For many of them, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much all
what internet means. But for the real things, they have no clue what they are
doing. Talk about the merits of a chaos money to test your infrastructure.
Well, the man on the street is pretty much the best you can get when it comes
to chaos testing your design and workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whatever infuriating it can be, it&amp;rsquo;s a great thing to keep in mind. People
have no clue what they are doing. They don&amp;rsquo;t know what an url is. They think
smileys are fun. They feel writing all in capitals is just a detail. When some
popup appears they consider it&amp;rsquo;s all broken and there is no need to read
what&amp;rsquo;s written on it because anyways that&amp;rsquo;s over their heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when you design your applications, you may be lucky enough to face an
educated population. But in many cases, you may not. Take it in account. Make
things over-explicit and use images to bypass the inability of the modern
average people to read anything that is more than a sentence of 5 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go volunteer to help your fellow neighbors in your local non-tech communities.
It&amp;rsquo;s hard, but it helps keep in touch with the reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And above all, keep patience. It&amp;rsquo;s not their fault. There has never been any
economical incentive to educate users. The shortest path is always the best
path. So for sure, you should make things easy. But if you get any occasion to
provide your users some education, it&amp;rsquo;s never going to be on your spec sheets.
You can do it as a natural thing to do. Add optional text to explain why
things are the way they are. Few will read it, but they will learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They begin to appear everywhere. I saw mine first on my passport, then I just
got my new credit card and it has one in it. Those things are nice if you
consider them naively. But the fact is that they are flawed and insecure. We
carry around more and more of those items that can be read at a proximity by
specially crafter devices. Gosh, did they not learn already from the ingenuity
of our kids?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been myths in science fiction about human implanted with chips.
Well, our phones for a while have been providing the same features. Call me
paranoid, but I just don&amp;rsquo;t like the feeling. And I also don&amp;rsquo;t like not having
any choice about it. Hopefully we can still &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/E_f5oRwaQew&#34;&gt;disable the credit cards RFID&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/BEyRfjeE6ac&#34;&gt;craft some pockets&lt;/a&gt; to put our passport in
it, or buy some &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/MhW-QLhmoVw&#34;&gt;faraday pockets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you pay attention, you can find or hear about phone apps called &amp;lsquo;electronic
pickpocket apps&amp;rsquo;. This choice of a name if so relevant to the situation. Note
that NFC, included in more and more phones, is a subcategory of RFID, operates
in much smaller range (10 cm). But basic RFID tags can be detected beyond 100
meters with proper antennas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talk about the Internet of Things. Sounds sexy. But clearly, we only are
one of the Things of that Internet. Without any implant, just by carrying
around passport and credit cards. Or by working at a company that uses that
technology for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wavetrend.net/personnel-tracking.php&#34;&gt;staff monitoring&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you,
but for me, it&amp;rsquo;s scary as hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;state-surveillance-in-france:2e160e3cd77d85bf5cb357e6e45cadd1&#34;&gt;State surveillance in France&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened this week in France is quite shocking. How can they be so long
to make useful laws and so quick to pass harmful ones? Well the move began in
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/11/french-officials-internet-users-real-time-law&#34;&gt;December last year&lt;/a&gt;. Some call it a French Patriot act. This
is not the first time there is an attempt from French government to enforce
stronger control on the internet. The pressure of lobbies and media industries
have been pushing hard to preserve their interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this time, it&amp;rsquo;s just about copying the NSA, and get legal requirement for
service providers to host the black boxes. Seems that the Snowden revelations
gave the lawmakers some ideas. The impact is not anecdotal in the French
society. Some service providers announce they will leave the country like
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/11/french-officials-internet-users-real-time-law&#34;&gt;Altern&lt;/a&gt; (French), others &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.mediapart.fr/blog/laurent-chemla/170415/lettre-ceux-qui-sen-foutent&#34;&gt;call to action&lt;/a&gt; (French). Both
Valentin and Laurent are long time activists in the French landscape. I know
them for a while. Funny how things turn out, I&amp;rsquo;m now working in the company
they founded in 99 (and passed hands in 2005).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all this makes me think that we are facing a technicality. The real thing
is systemic. It seems that we failed, as a civilization, to regain control
over our systems. The course of evolution is going to lead to more control to
the machines, more dependence on the computerized information. Up to a point
where our insignificance as human being will become really obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, as small makers of this computerized universe, should have some part of
responsibility. Is there a way that we can bend the course of history by the
small choices we make? Can we not take decisions in regard of how to implement
solutions, in a way that we can preserve a margin of freedom and respect for
the human species? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure, at this point, there is anything we can do.
But if we don&amp;rsquo;t try, we will never know. Think about it. You build systems.
You shape the world. Your choice matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;working-abroad:a0091e7eb1dfeca477447c7e0b2e6425&#34;&gt;Working abroad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our craft as webdev is clearly in huge demand. This provides an opportunity
for us to travel abroad, discover new cultures, widen our horizon. When I went
to live in Taiwan, I was not worried about finding a job. But when hunting for
a job abroad it can be tricky to find companies that will sponsor a visa, a
work permit, or whatever legal requirement is involved in each countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what the new initiative called &lt;a href=&#34;http://techmeabroad.com&#34;&gt;TechMeAbroad&lt;/a&gt; aims to fix, by
listing only job opportunities for which a work permit is sponsored. As
&lt;a href=&#34;http://jbarbier42.tumblr.com/post/112155851079/introducing-techmeabroad&#34;&gt;Julien Barbier explains&lt;/a&gt;, it will launch in march, and if you know of any
job offers that includes a visa or such thing, please let him know (or send it
to me I will pass it along), so we can feed that platform with some real data
quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-long-ruby-1-9:a0091e7eb1dfeca477447c7e0b2e6425&#34;&gt;So long ruby 1.9&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As planned, it&amp;rsquo;s now time to say &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2015/02/23/support-for-ruby-1-9-3-has-ended/&#34;&gt;byebye to ruby 1.9.3&lt;/a&gt;. But there is still
so many old version of ruby in the wild. In debian squeeze, you gotta use 1.8.
In wheezy, you have 1.9. And there are still many servers that will refuse to
upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pick-your-hero:a0091e7eb1dfeca477447c7e0b2e6425&#34;&gt;Pick your hero&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The registration for &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubyheroes.com/&#34;&gt;Ruby Heroes 2015&lt;/a&gt; is now open. Go vote for your
favorite ruby influential dev. You have until &lt;a href=&#34;http://railsconf.com/&#34;&gt;railsconf&lt;/a&gt; that will happen
in april, in Atlanta this year.&lt;/p&gt;
