      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I love website pre-generation concept I have been using &lt;a href=&#34;http://jekyllrb.com&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://octopress.org&#34;&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt; quite a lot. But now I wanted to give a try to &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I have had various spaces of blogging in the past few years, so I thought I should just recenter everything in a unique place. There was an old blog on tumblr because I wanted to see how it was made. Then I had a period of time where I was publishing tips on the Faria Devtips website, which is down now. Then I also publish some rants every week on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://greenruby.org&#34;&gt;Greenruby&lt;/a&gt; newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only the last on is still active, so I will cross-post things from there to here, which should not be too hard as they are both markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first impression of Hugo is that there are still a lot of small weird things. But in some ways, I&amp;rsquo;m kind of happy about it, I guess I will try to fix some of those, that will be an occasion to play a little with golang.&lt;/p&gt;
