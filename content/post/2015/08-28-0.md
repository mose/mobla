As I love website pre-generation concept I have been using [Jekyll][1] and [Octopress][2] quite a lot. But now I wanted to give a try to [Hugo][3]. 

Also, I have had various spaces of blogging in the past few years, so I thought I should just recenter everything in a unique place. There was an old blog on tumblr because I waanted to see how it was made. Then I had a period of time where I was publishing toips on the Faria Devtips website, which is down now. Then I also publish some rants every week on the [Greenruby][4] newletter.

Only the last on is still active, so I will crosspost things from there to here, whichg should not be too hard as they are both markdown.

The first impression of Hugo is that there are still a lot of small weird things. But in some ways, I'm kind of happy about it, I guess I will try to fix some of those, that will be an occasion to play a little with golang.
