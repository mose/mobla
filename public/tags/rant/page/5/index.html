<h2 id="the-dimensions-of-coding:b983cb306bd4bcf38c9b84ac40779659">The dimensions of coding</h2>

<p>Today while wandering around in my weekly hunt for good links, my eye has been
attracted by a post named <a href="https://medium.com/@scosta/coding-is-three-dimensional-cb331d1b4ad8">Coding is three dimensional</a>. It&rsquo;s quite an
interesting way to consider it. But the reason why it struck me is that it was
missing the fourth dimension. That makes all the difference when you get years
of coding. You know that time is a parameter.</p>

<p>Code don&rsquo;t exist out of time. It has a past, perspective of a future, that
both shape its current morphology. There are a lot of efforts to produce code
analysis. But the real analyst is an historian and needs a systemic approach
that includes time as a factor. We are still far from being able to automate
that. In some ways, it&rsquo;s a good news, we won&rsquo;t be replaced by small scripts
very soon.</p>

<p>The time factor is actually the essential element in the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html">technical debt</a>
formula. Purist coders can&rsquo;t cope with technical debt but if you have two
onces of business man inside, it makes total sense. The tradeoff in technical
quality versus fast deliverability only makes sense because the timing is
critical. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/a-mess-is-not-a-technical-debt">A mess is not a technical debt</a>.</p>

<p>If coding was disconnected from the market, and if it was not a business or
more like an art, maybe time would not be that critical. But even open source
software is dependent on the market at one point or another. I fail to see how
it could be different.</p>

<p>Honestly, I would prefer clean coding and no market tradeoff, but that&rsquo;s just
a dream.</p>

<h2 id="just-met-hugo:7f9ce9f83e9126826117a493b10fad98">Just met Hugo</h2>

<p>Some weeks ago I was talking about Octopress. I think pre-generation of
websites is a very sensible approach. And I heard about <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> for some
time now. It&rsquo;s like a cousin of Jekyll but writen in Go. The author of
Middleman (another site generation engine) confessed in a <a href="https://changelog.com/169/">recent podcast</a>
that he would try the Golang way if he had to start from
scratch today.</p>

<p>I got interested into Hugo mostly because one of the side projects I&rsquo;m working
on. It involves a bunch of people that run on windows. Having a binary that
runs everywhere is a big plus for a gGo solution. Installing ruby is possible
on windows, but not really for noobs afaict.</p>

<p>Also, I want to check more Go projects. I have been playing in and out that
language for a while now. Version 1.5 seems really great. So I upgraded my
<a href="https://github.com/moovweb/gvm">gvm</a> and installed the thing. Well, I could havce just used the Hugo
binary, but where is the fun in that?</p>

<p>My first impression is very comfortable. It took a lot of the principles form
Jekyll. But it seems to have some extra options and concepts that may be a
little more advanced and seem very promising. The theming system is especially
cool. I will probably first port my own blog under Hugo before porting my
other project.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, that&rsquo;s a while I&rsquo;m considering that I never feed my blog,
but I should copy the rants I write here in there. It can be fun to add a rake
task in the greenruby publication process to also add a page in a nearby hugo
repo and publish it at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="sexism-and-competition:db2c111cf24dad5b31c1182c9980822d">Sexism and competition</h2>

<p>The ruby community is quite blessed in the way that there are very vocal
activist promoting diversity, especially on <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">gender parity</a>. It&rsquo;s
not exclusive to ruby I noticed the same intention in other communities (like
the <a href="http://www.pyladies.com/">pyladies</a> in python).</p>

<p>Anybody that spent some years in IT cannot avoid to notice that there are
mostly guys. The ladies are either frowned upon or very special cases. For
ages I have been wondering why. My sister is a sysadmin at a university, there
is nothing shocking about that and she does a damn good job.</p>

<p>So I paid attention on what are the people responsible for that. I identified
various categories of people that I consider are responsible of our lack of
parity. Well, not them directly but the behaviors they perpetuate are
certainly part of the problem. If we could find a way to correct those
behaviors, it would lead to a natural change in the group.</p>

<p>In all those people I know, and in all their behaviors, I think I detected
something that is related to the Religion Of Competitiveness. Those people are
believers that knowledge is power and they are not gonna share it more than
necessary. They will find anything to avoid more people reach their level of
knowledge. And if they can find some kind of reason to discard other people,
either trivial and socially acceptable in the given group reason to discard
other people, they will do. Gender is the first victim in such a schema. What
is socially acceptable is a self-perpetuated meme.</p>

<p>Talking to those people is pointless, they are in denial. They see nothing
wrong. You can&rsquo;t change them. You have to change their environment, that will
be the only way.</p>

<p>So it means that in a competition context, there are still ways to win, by
playing the competition game and winning it. But to break the competition
paradigm, there is a lot to do. Companies policies are not enough to enforce a
more open mindset. But I believe that there is ways to organize the
information in a way that keeping it for oneself devaluates it. And from the
eradication of the tyranny of knowledge, we shall reach a less
competition-based culture in IT. And all discrimination pretexts may vanish by
themselves.</p>

<p>Rather than fighting for diversity, we should fight against the spirit of
competition. It&rsquo;s kind of not easy, I reckon, because our society tends to
push people to be competitive. That&rsquo;s what capitalism is all about. But IT
population already has proven that the established system don&rsquo;t take hold on
them. Geeks and techies are educated people (often self-educated, but it&rsquo;s the
same) and they can think on their own, chose the path to follow. If you can
find a way, in your context, to change the environment towards less power for
the competitive type of people, that could deserve a try.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s just a rant, a wild thought. Such a topic would deserve more
space for development. But that&rsquo;s what I wanted to share this week. Anyways I
doubt there is that much people reading those line hahaha.</p>

<h2 id="octopress-3-and-other-thoughts:cfcdc78d89eef0c0b12f3b5b0fcf318d">Octopress 3 and other thoughts</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently involved in a community project and I installed a wordpress.
From time to time I get one up to see how it evolves. But really this thing is
not to my taste. To much trouble for making simple things. I reckon it can be
useful for people with no technical knowledge but then they are going to mess
up everything. The technical advisor still can&rsquo;t be avoided.</p>

<p>So because now I saw a recent wordpress and didn&rsquo;t like it more than the
previous attempts, I will give a try to the new <a href="http://octopress.org/">octopress 3.0</a>.
The octopress author <a href="http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/">explains</a> that he&rsquo;s been doing it all wrong and now
on version 3.0 he gets back to sort of a collection of gems that plug into
jekyll. I kind of like the idea.</p>

<p>Well to be honest I was also tempted to give a try to <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/">phoenix</a>, but
I know jekyll already and I don&rsquo;t have that much server resources for that
community project. Static web always have had my preference. But the idea
behind Phoenix is appealing. Like any new project it includes the new things
and don&rsquo;t have to bother about legacy. The channels ideas, creating a stream
between client and server, sounds very appealing.</p>

<p>But to get back to why I will prefer jekyll over wordpress, is that my
contributors are a mess. They don&rsquo;t care about styling, they copy-paste random
html all over the place and the final look is totally inconsistent. My hope is
that markdown would limit the possibilities of making a mess. But then I will
have to propose them the github edit, as a backend, unless I cheat and use
etherpad-lite as a pre-production backend.</p>

<p>That <a href="http://etherpad.org/">etherpad-lite</a> thing is amazingly simple, I used sometimes and
making it accessible behind a single password for everybody makes tings pretty
direct. But totally unsafe, I reckon. I will probably have to write some kind
of tool for managing the publication workflow. Hmm, that sounds like fun. If
you ever had the same kind of adventure, please <a href="mailto:mose@greenruby.org">share with me</a> :)</p>

<h2 id="rubyconf-taiwan-2015:6f1441b48959350386774005adafb7a6">RubyConf Taiwan 2015</h2>

<p>In September 11 and 12 there is a <a href="http://2015.rubyconf.tw/">Rubyconf here in Taiwan</a>. I have
been at some past editions and it&rsquo;s always a good time to meet people. Because
we are close to Japan there is usually pretty good ruby core contributors from
there. We get to see Matz, father of ruby, at each edition. But this time it
seems that the organizers pulled some kind of special trick and the famous
<a href="http://tenderlovemaking.com/">Aaron Patterson</a> will be present. And I remember having heard
<a href="http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/149-rr-ruby-in-government-with-sarah-allen">Sarah Allen on rubyrogues</a> last year, it is the first time she joins
us in Taiwan too. I think both of them will bring some unique taste to this
years rubyconf.</p>

<p>If you looked for an occasion to visit Taiwan, that may be the right time. You
won&rsquo;t regret it. The ruby community in Taiwan is quite active and Taiwanese
people are amazingly welcoming to westerners.</p>

<p>And, if you want to meet the 3 of us, we will all be there. Look around for
Xenor and Tysliu, the famous editors of the Green Ruby newsletter. They
tirelessly collect links and news, fresh from the week, about ruby and other
things. And if you see someone with a Gandi T-Shirt, that will probably be me.
We probably will distribute some green ruby stickers that I still have in
stock. So then we can make new ones.</p>

<h2 id="back-on-tweeting:7ae99486640ad70a650c6bd616a3b6cb">Back on tweeting</h2>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t like my phone. As an old timer I&rsquo;m reluctant to trust my
android, but it would be the same on an iphone. The way applications require
access to the device, on android, is especially annoying and dishonest. They
make the slope slippery for the sake of saving seconds in adopting new apps,
but it&rsquo;s leading to a total remission of users control over their devices.</p>

<p>But well, I still have a commute several times a week and I use my phone to
listen to various podcasts. But I recently configured some accounts and some
news readers, so I also can just do some links curation along the way. So I
suspect there will be more tweeting on the <a href="https://twitter.com/greenrubist">greenrubist</a> account from
now on. It helps quite a lot when I want to gather links on every sundays.</p>

<p>Well, nowadays, most of the links are actually gathered by xenor and tysliu,
but I always add a few on my own (especially the devops ones). Those 2 guys
are really doing an amazing demonstration of consistency. After 129 editions,
we still didn&rsquo;t miss a single one week in our publication. It would not have
been possible without my buddies. Thanks so much for their contribution.</p>

<a href="http://fossbytes.com/nsa-open-sources-its-linux-based-cyber-security-tool/">open source code</a>. Check the <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency">NSA github repository</a>, they
released something already. <a href="https://github.com/simp">Simp</a> especially has a bunch of puppet
modules, but it&rsquo;s designed only for redhat kind of systems. Quite an
interesting move.</p>

<h2 id="javascript-and-thoughts-on-programming:5d8b105fb300dee4745f73b31fcdff54">Javascript and thoughts on programming</h2>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been playing with Hubot plugins code in coffeescript for our
company. That&rsquo;s a while I didn&rsquo;t do much js but I used it for a long time and
I didn&rsquo;t find it too difficult to catch up. But for some reason, it brought me
the same feeling I have each time I get back to that language. I feel dirty.
Still I can do what I need to do, for sure, but I don&rsquo;t feel like a builder,
more like an acrobat. And I&rsquo;m far from a purist.</p>

<p>Some people talk about javascript taking over the world. But that language
imho just was there at the right place at the right time. By having a runtime
embedded in browsers and browsers libraries, it has been used to hijack the
most used software on our computers and mobile devices, to transform them into
richer clients. Along the way various layers were added to fulfill the need of
software design, because javascript initial goal was merely DOM manipulation.</p>

<p>The thing that always stroke me the most with javascript is that despite the
efforts from ecmascript, it has no formal standard or documentation. It is
pretty extensively documented, of course, but because the language is pushed
forward by the implementations rather than from a standard body, it gets a bit
messy.</p>

<p>I saw a <a href="http://cube-drone.com/comics/c/relentless-persistence">drawing</a> this week that illustrates the mess quite well. It feels
like Javascript is waiting for something to come replace it.</p>

<p>But there is hope with ES6. Seems like in recent years the normative effort on
the ecmascript standard got some more traction and some more press coverage.
But I personally don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to bring the solution. I enjoyed
reading the <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/future-programming-webassembly-life-after-javascript/">thoughts of Eric Elliot</a> on that topic but I&rsquo;m not sure
he&rsquo;s right on everything. But what he&rsquo;s right about, is that there will be an
after-javascript.</p>

<p>Unless that after javascript doesn&rsquo;t arrive fast enough and gets useless by
some new programming paradigm that may appear one day soon. I mean, in the
next 10 years. At some point, like big data is too complex to be handled by
human, programming will also get too complex and will be handled by
algorithms. We already <a href="http://phys.org/news/2015-07-code-faster-expert.html">see it coming</a>. And all programmers will then
become high end workflow designers or just play with antiquities.</p>

<p>In this perspective, I think javascript is a great intermediary technology for
the time being, given its pervasive aspect. It&rsquo;s far from satisfying, but it
does the job. But the younger generation should keep an eye on higher level
abstract approaches, like systems architectures, workflow logics, organization
patterns, because imho that will drive software design in the next 10-20
years.</p>

<h2 id="digital-generations:2aa08ef814c13d38c5b673b5d5882db4">Digital Generations</h2>

<p>I enjoyed very much watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TGJJ-F-fE">keynote from Grady Booch at ICSE</a>
last week. He retraces the whole history of computing and software engineering
in a very talented way.</p>

<p>Later on I also watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kEJoWfobpA">keynote of Stephen Bourne at BSDCan</a>,
which also talked about history, but on a specific topic of the creation of
Unix and the shell.</p>

<p>Usually, I have to say, I consider myself as an old geek. But I&rsquo;m a kid
compared to those guys. It made me wonder what are generations based on the
computerized world. In the physical world it&rsquo;s easy, there are births and
generations are around 20-30 years long. But in our accelerated time frame in
the digital age, what is the measure for generations and where are the gaps ?</p>

<p>We could consider that some breakthrough are the base of generational shifts.
On the top of my head I would say:</p>

<ul>
<li>the dinosaurs age, before 70, where computing was just emerging</li>
<li>the university age, appearing with the interconnectivity between universities between 70 and 80</li>
<li>the personal computer age, between 80 and 94, with various evolutions of pc available to larger audience</li>
<li>the hypertext age, between 94 and 2002, start of the public internet, the bubble, the web</li>
<li>the online age, from 2002 to 2012, with consolidation of big companies, web 2.0 and all</li>
<li>the mobile age, from 2012 to now, even if mobile appeared previously, it dominates since recently</li>
</ul>

<p>So I can see an average of 8-15 years in the generations that I feel create
disruptions between each others. People that jump in at one age will suffer a
gap between their age and the next one. Many won&rsquo;t evolve. Few brave ones will
constantly update and jump on the next train.</p>

<p>But the overlap in digital generations is also different than in traditional
generations. We still have a lot of legacy in our current systems inherited
form the university age. And they don&rsquo;t seem to die, like the TCP stack or the
C language.</p>

<p>The next age may be the one of the Internet of things and the massive required
switch to IPv6 as default. Which will include automated and autonomous
systems, because they will be things and not part of a contained system. In
something like 3 to 5 years, if I follow the same rough pattern I drew above.
Unless next gap will come with VR and immersive technologies ?</p>

<p>But I suspect that my simplistic characterization misses all the multi-layered
aspect of the digital age, between the hardware advancements, the software
improvements, the usages evolutions, the protocols modifications, the data
models transformations, etc. I&rsquo;m sure a more complex generational matrix could
be designed if some more thought was given to it. But the gaps are real.</p>

<p>It feels to me that people that predict that machines are going to take over
the world are actually late, it already happened 40 years ago. It was just
having a limited impact on people lives. Each digital generation dragging more
human in its trails.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let yourself enclosed in a generation. Our computer overlords won&rsquo;t make
any effort to include you if you drag your feet.</p>

<h2 id="a-taste-of-freebsd:2e9f17a4684b1292d2dd8dbb76b48337">a taste of FreeBSD</h2>

<p>This weekend I installed <a href="http://freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a> 10.1 on a disk of my desktop.
Beyond the fact that we are using that system at work, more and more, I was
just curious about the setup for a desktop. I was pleasantly surprised and
everything went very smoothly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m quite familiar with Linux and that was enough for making the ride very
easy. The general impression is that actually the system is simpler than on
Linux, maybe more consistent. The pkg system, alternative to the traditional
ports system, makes thing much more &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo;.</p>

<p>And for the rest, well, in one afternoon, and just by following the doc, I had
my window manager up and running, and ready to begin playing with
<a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/bhyve">bhyve</a>. I was surprised to see that bhyve kernel modules were included
by default in recent releases. I heard there are still some bumps on the road
for laptop about the sleep to disk mode, but I&rsquo;m not concerned by that.</p>

<p>It feels like BSD is a shy actor that actually powers much more stuff that we
can suspect. But it has a pretty active community and a very decent
documentation. Well, give it a try if you like playing with various
distributions of free and open operating systems. It&rsquo;s much less scary that
its reputation seems to convey.</p>
